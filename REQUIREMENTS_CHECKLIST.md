## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **ALWAYS update MASTER_GUIDE.md** with changes
2. **Test on live platform** before deploying
3. **Read actual implementation code** - no guessing
4. **Follow frictionless principle** - publicProcedure by default
5. **ProfileGuard integration** - every module must use unified profile
6. **Evidence-based** - all recommendations must cite sources (once Keepers of Truth is implemented)
