## ❓ DECISION POINTS

**Brother, I need your input on:**

1. **Timeline:** Do you need this before first client? Or can we launch basic and evolve?

2. **Budget:** Can you invest $10K/year in API costs? Or need cheaper alternatives?

3. **Priority:** Is this #1 priority? Or should we finish other features first?

4. **Approach:** Full build (10 weeks)? MVP (2 weeks)? Hybrid (6 weeks)?

5. **Training:** Do you want to be involved in testing/feedback during development?

## ✅ WHAT I RECOMMEND

**Start with Phase 1 (2 weeks):**
- Real-time transcription
- Speaker identification
- Compliance engine
- Talk time monitoring

**Why:**
1. **Immediate value** - Helps you TODAY
2. **Foundation** - Everything else builds on this
3. **Validates concept** - Test with real sessions
4. **Cost-effective** - Only $0.75/session
5. **Quick win** - 2 weeks to working system

**Then decide:**
- If it's valuable → Continue to Phase 2-3
- If not → Pivot to other features
- If needs changes → Adjust based on feedback

**Your call, brother! What's the priority?** 💪
