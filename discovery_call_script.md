# HIGH-CONVERTING DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT
## Purposeful Live Coaching - 15-Minute Free Discovery Call

---

## OPENING (2 minutes)
### Pattern Interrupt + Authority + Warmth

**[SMILE - They can hear it in your voice]**

> "Hi [NAME], this is Carl from Purposeful Live Coaching. Before we dive in, I want you to know - this isn't a sales call. This is YOUR time. I'm here to understand where you are, where you want to be, and whether I can genuinely help you get there. If I can't, I'll tell you. Fair enough?"

**[PAUSE - Let them respond]**

> "Perfect. So [NAME], what made you book this call today? What's going on in your life right now?"

**[LISTEN DEEPLY - Take notes on their exact words]**

---

## DISCOVERY (5 minutes)
### Emotional Excavation + Pain Amplification

**After they share, reflect back using their exact words:**

> "So if I'm hearing you right, you're dealing with [THEIR WORDS]. How long has this been going on?"

**[Let them answer]**

> "And how is that affecting other areas of your life? Your relationships? Your energy? Your confidence?"

**[Let them expand - this is where the real pain surfaces]**

**The Critical Question:**

> "[NAME], on a scale of 1-10, how urgent is it for you to change this? And what made you pick that number instead of something lower?"

**[This makes them sell themselves on why change is urgent]**

---

## FUTURE SELF VISUALIZATION (4 minutes)
### Future Pacing + Identity Shift

**Bridge to the future:**

> "[NAME], I want you to imagine something with me. Close your eyes if you're comfortable..."

> "Imagine it's 90 days from now. You wake up and something is different. The weight you've been carrying? It's gone. You look in the mirror and you see someone who [INSERT THEIR GOAL - confident/in control/at peace/energized]."

> "What does your morning look like? How do you feel when you get out of bed?"

**[Let them describe it - they're building their own vision]**

> "And when you show up at work/with your family/in your life - how do people respond to this new version of you?"

**[Let them paint the picture]**

> "That person you just described? That's not a fantasy. That's who you actually are underneath all the noise. My job is to help you remove what's blocking you from being that person every single day."

---

## THE BRIDGE (2 minutes)
### Tribe + Social Proof + Scarcity

> "[NAME], what you're describing is exactly what my clients come to me with. Just last month, I worked with someone in a very similar situation - [BRIEF RELEVANT STORY - 2 sentences max]. Within 6 weeks, they [SPECIFIC RESULT]."

> "Here's what I know after coaching hundreds of people: The gap between where you are and where you want to be isn't as big as it feels. It's usually 2-3 key shifts that change everything."

> "I have a few spots open this month for new clients. Based on what you've shared, I genuinely believe I can help you. The question is - are you ready to do the work?"

---

## THE CLOSE (2 minutes)
### Assumptive Close + Urgency

**If they seem ready:**

> "Here's what I'd suggest. Let's get you started with [PACKAGE NAME]. We'll have our first full session this week while everything we talked about is fresh. I'll send you a link right after this call. Sound good?"

**If they hesitate:**

> "[NAME], I get it. This is a decision. But let me ask you something - what happens if you don't do anything? Where will you be in 90 days if nothing changes?"

**[Let them answer - they'll convince themselves]**

> "The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is today. What's holding you back?"

**Handle the objection, then:**

> "Look, I'm not going to pressure you. But I will say this - the fact that you booked this call tells me something. Part of you is ready. The question is whether you're going to listen to that part or let fear win again."

---

## EMERGENCY CLOSES

### "I need to think about it"
> "Totally understand. What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the investment, the time commitment, or something else?"

### "I can't afford it"
> "I hear you. Let me ask - what is it costing you NOT to solve this? Your energy, your relationships, your potential? Sometimes the most expensive thing is staying stuck."

### "I need to talk to my spouse"
> "Of course. What do you think they'll say? And more importantly - what do YOU want? This is about your growth."
