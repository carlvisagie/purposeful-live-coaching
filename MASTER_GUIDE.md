# PART 1: FOUNDATIONAL VISION {#foundational-vision}

> **"I bow to truth and reality, whatever the research proves is what we do, any other way is just wasting time, money, and will surely lead to disappointment."**

## 🎯 PLATFORM FOUNDATIONAL CAPABILITIES

### 1. Autonomous AI Coaching System

**Vision:** A fully autonomous AI coaching platform that:
- Onboards clients with frictionless flow (full access → free tier after 7 days)
- Uses evidence-based methods (Chase Hughes, Cialdini, behavioral science) to guide clients toward paid tiers
- Provides transformational coaching that makes lives better
- **Moral obligation:** If we fail to help them, they might use less competent platforms

**Self-Learning Requirements:**
- ✅ **Built:** Platform Intelligence Engine - aggregates data from all modules
- ✅ **Built:** Truth Keepers - validates research for empirical quality only
- ✅ **Built:** Adaptive Learning - tracks technique effectiveness per client
- ✅ **Built:** Self-evolving compliance rules based on what works
- 🟡 **In Progress:** Scraping known universe for latest research
- 🟡 **In Progress:** Auto-updating modules with new science

### 2. Human Coaching with AI Assistant

# PART 2: GUIDING PRINCIPLES {#guiding-principles}

## Core Operating Philosophy

1. **Evidence-Based Only:** Only empirical research matters. Level A/B evidence (RCTs, meta-analyses) accepted. Everything else is filtered out by Truth Keepers.

2. **Self-Learning Systems:** Every module must:
   - Track its own effectiveness
   - Learn from client outcomes
   - Update itself with new research
   - Evolve toward what clients actually need

3. **Platform-Wide Intelligence:** The platform aggregates ALL data from ALL modules across ALL clients to:
   - Detect patterns and trends
   - Generate insights and recommendations
   - Move perpetually toward serving clients better

4. **One-and-Done:** Don't rebuild what's built properly. Focus effort on missing features, not polish of existing excellence.

5. **Revenue Blockers First:** Fix what blocks revenue before aesthetic improvements.

# CHANGELOG

## CHANGELOG: Video-Analyzing Interview Coach with GPT-4 Vision (December 19, 2025)

### MAJOR UPGRADE: The Interview Coach Now ACTUALLY WATCHES You!

**Problem Solved:**
- Previous coach only analyzed spoken words, not visual presentation
- No feedback on eye contact, posture, facial expressions, or body language
- Users reported coach was "aggressive" and not observant

**What Was Built:**

**1. Video Frame Capture System** (`client/src/components/AviationKnowledgeCoach.tsx`)
- Captures video frames every 3 seconds during practice
- Stores up to 5 key frames for comprehensive analysis
- Hidden canvas element for frame extraction
- Sends frames to server with speech transcript

**2. GPT-4 Vision Integration** (`server/routers/aviationKnowledge.ts`)
- Server accepts `videoFrames` array alongside speech transcript
- Uses GPT-4 Vision to analyze BOTH audio AND visual presentation
- Analyzes: eye contact, posture, facial expressions, gestures, energy

**3. Warm, Adaptive Coaching Tone**
- Detects user sentiment (nervous, confident, struggling)
- Adapts coaching style based on detected state
- Extra supportive for users who seem nervous
- Always leads with genuine praise
- Frames improvements as opportunities, never criticisms

**4. Visual Feedback UI**
- New "Visual Presentation Feedback" section in evaluation
- Shows: Eye Contact, Posture, Voice & Tone, Energy & Presence
- Beautiful purple-themed feedback cards
- "Next Step" tip for actionable improvement

**Files Changed:**
- `client/src/components/AviationKnowledgeCoach.tsx` - Frame capture + UI
- `server/routers/aviationKnowledge.ts` - GPT-4 Vision integration

**Commit:** `2dbbe2f`

---

## December 19, 2025 - Health Optimization System Added

### What Was Built

**1. Health Optimization Router** (`server/routers/healthOptimization.ts`)
- Full API exposing the existing health schema
- Endpoints: `getHealthStatus`, `getProfile`, `submitHealthIntake`, `updateDailyMetrics`, `addBiomarker`, `getHealthSummary`
- Calculates biological age, mortality risk factors, and profile completeness

**2. Health Intake Questionnaire** (`client/src/components/HealthIntakeQuestionnaire.tsx`)
- 8-step comprehensive health assessment wizard
- Collects: Demographics, Current Health, Goals, Medical History, Lifestyle, Sleep/Stress, Mental Health, Consent
- Evidence-based questions aligned with longevity science research
- Takes ~5 minutes to complete

**3. Session Health Disclaimer** (`client/src/components/SessionHealthDisclaimer.tsx`)
- Shows before AI/Live coaching sessions
- Encourages users to complete health assessment for optimal coaching
- Includes medical disclaimer: "This is wellness coaching, not medical advice"
- Users can skip but are reminded that coaching will be less personalized

**4. Integration with Voice Coach**
- When clicking "Start Voice Call", health check shows first
- If health assessment completed: Shows quick confirmation and proceeds
- If not completed: Prompts user to complete or skip
- All coaching sessions now have health context

### Why This Matters

> "We can not do a proper diagnosis without understanding clients health"

This system ensures:
- Every coaching interaction is personalized to the client's health profile
- Coaches (AI and human) know about conditions, medications, goals
- Proper disclaimers protect the platform legally
- Data collection enables future mortality screening and biomarker tracking

### Files Changed
- `server/routers/healthOptimization.ts` (NEW)
- `server/routers.ts` (added healthOptimization router)
- `client/src/components/HealthIntakeQuestionnaire.tsx` (NEW)
- `client/src/components/SessionHealthDisclaimer.tsx` (NEW)
- `client/src/pages/OwnerControlCenterV2.tsx` (integrated health check)

### Deployment
Pushed to GitHub: Commit `356a789`
Render auto-deploys.

---

## CHANGELOG: Freedom Dashboard (December 19, 2025)

### What Was Built

**Freedom Dashboard** (`client/src/pages/FreedomDashboard.tsx`)
- Real-time marketing and business intelligence dashboard
- Path to Freedom progress tracker (MRR goal tracking)
- Key metrics: MRR, Users, Conversion Rate, Customer LTV
- Revenue vs Target charts with Recharts
- User growth visualization
- Marketing channel performance tracking
- Feature adoption metrics
- 90-day goals tracking
- Freedom milestones (First Customer → $50K MRR)
- Next actions for growth

### Routes Added

### Files Changed
- `client/src/pages/FreedomDashboard.tsx` (NEW)
- `client/src/App.tsx` (added routes)

### Deployment
Pushed to GitHub: Commit `ab6b6ed`
Render auto-deploys.

---
## CHANGELOG: Choice-Based Onboarding (December 19, 2025)
### Research-Driven Implementation
Based on research showing 70% of users prefer conversational data gathering over forms, we implemented a choice-based onboarding system.

### What Changed
Users now see two options when starting AI coaching:
1. **"Let's Chat"** (Conversational) - AI learns about user naturally through conversation
2. **"Complete Profile"** (Form) - Traditional health intake questionnaire

### Self-Learning Platform
- `onboardingAnalytics.ts` tracks which option users choose
- Platform learns from user behavior over time
- Data helps optimize the onboarding experience

### Files Added
- `client/src/lib/onboardingAnalytics.ts` - Tracks user preferences
- `client/src/components/OnboardingChoice.tsx` - Choice UI component

### Files Modified
- `SessionHealthDisclaimer.tsx` - Now shows choice between chat vs form
- `HealthIntakeQuestionnaire.tsx` - Works without login (saves to localStorage)

### Commit
`742f102` - Add choice-based onboarding: conversational vs form

---
## CHANGELOG: Speech-to-Text Fix (December 19, 2025))

### Issue Found
Speech-to-text in the Aviation Knowledge Coach (Interview Prep) was producing duplicated text. Users would speak once but the transcript would repeat the same content multiple times.

### Root Cause
- The Web Speech API with `continuous = true` mode re-sends all previous results on each `onresult` event
- The code was iterating through ALL results and appending to transcript, causing duplication
- Line 99: `setTranscript(prev => prev + finalTranscript)` was re-adding already processed results

### Fix Applied
- Commit `d457a98`: Added `lastResultIndexRef` to track which results have been processed
- Now only processes NEW results starting from the last processed index
- Reset the index tracker when starting a new recording

### Files Changed
- `client/src/components/AviationKnowledgeCoach.tsx`

---

## CHANGELOG: Settings Page Fix (December 19, 2025)

### Issue Found
Settings page (`/settings`) was returning 404 error. The gear icon in the header linked to a non-existent page.

### Root Cause
- Settings.tsx was created but had incorrect import path for `useAuth` hook
- Import was `@/hooks/useAuth` but correct path is `@/_core/hooks/useAuth`

### Fix Applied
- Commit `8812eef`: Created Settings.tsx with 4 tabs (Profile, Notifications, Preferences, Security)
- Commit `3f4bfc0`: Fixed useAuth import path

### Settings Page Features
| Tab | Features |
|-----|----------|
| Profile | First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Timezone |
| Notifications | Email/Push/SMS toggles, Daily Reminder, Weekly Report, Session Reminders |
| Preferences | Dark Mode, Sound Effects, Auto-play Videos |
| Security | Change Password, Subscription info, Upgrade Plan, Log Out, Delete Account |

### Deployment
Pushed to GitHub: Commits `8812eef` and `3f4bfc0`
Render auto-deployed successfully.

## CHANGELOG: 10X Adaptive Emotional Intelligence Voice Coaching (December 19, 2025)

### CRITICAL UPGRADE - Make-or-Break Feature for Client Retention

**Problem Identified:** User tested the Real-Time Voice Coach and found it:
- Aggressive/harsh tone (like a drill sergeant)
- Not listening to client needs
- Giving generic/unhelpful responses
- Not adapting to user's emotional state

**User Quote:** "I'm not going to learn shit from her" - This was losing clients.

### Solution: 10X Adaptive Emotional Intelligence System

**Research Foundation:**
- Working alliance is the #1 predictor of coaching outcomes (Graßmann et al., 2020 - 291 citations)
- Mirroring creates subconscious trust and rapport
- Pacing and leading: match their state first, then gently guide
- Psychological safety enables learning and growth

### New Coach Personas

| Coach | Mode | Personality |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Alex** | Speaker Training | Warm, perceptive mentor who notices subtle shifts |
| **Jordan** | Interview Prep | Strategic, confidence-building, believes in you |
| **Morgan** | Coaching Practice | Wise, patient teacher who models excellence |
| **Sam** | Compliance Monitor | Supportive guardrail, explains the WHY |
| **Riley** | Singing Coach | Encouraging, celebrates uniqueness |

### Adaptive Features Built

**1. Real-Time Emotional Detection**
- Short responses → "I sense something shifted. What's coming up for you?"
- Pushback/resistance → "Let me adjust my approach. What would be more helpful?"
- Repeated mistakes → "Let's pause. Take a breath. You're doing better than you think."
- Energy drops → "I want to make sure this is landing. How are you feeling?"
- Excitement/flow → "Yes! That's exactly it! You're in the zone!"

**2. Permission-Based Challenging**
- "Would you be open to some direct feedback?"
- "Can I push you a little here? I think you can handle more."
- "I have an observation that might be uncomfortable. Want to hear it?"

**3. Frequent Check-Ins**
- "How's this feeling for you?"
- "Is this the kind of feedback that's helpful?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you feeling right now?"
- "What would make this session most valuable for you?"

**4. Energy Mirroring**
- If nervous/quiet → Be gentle, warm, speak softly
- If excited/fast → Match energy, ride momentum
- If frustrated → Slow down, soften voice, acknowledge feelings
- If confident → Be more direct, challenge appropriately

## CHANGELOG: Session-to-Profile Extraction System (December 19, 2025)

### Comprehensive Client Intelligence from Voice Sessions

**Problem Identified:** Voice coaching sessions weren't automatically feeding into the unified client profile. Coaches had no "CliffsNotes" before sessions, and valuable session insights were being lost.

**Research Foundation:**
- ICF Core Competencies (2025): Trust, Communication, Growth
- SOAP Notes: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan
- DAP Notes: Data, Assessment, Plan  
- BIRP Notes: Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan
- AI coaching summarization best practices (Insight7, Otter.ai, Grain)

### Solution: Comprehensive Session-to-Profile Extraction

**What Gets Extracted (Automatically):**

| Category | Data Extracted |
|----------|---------------|
| Demographics | Age, location, occupation, industry, relationship status |
| Goals | Primary goal (exact words), secondary goals, motivation, timeline, success metrics |
| Observations | Presenting concerns, strengths, growth areas, behavioral patterns, emotional patterns, risk indicators |
| Session Doc | Topics discussed, techniques used, client responses, breakthroughs, challenges, emotional journey |
| Progress | Goal progress (0-100%), milestones achieved, behavioral changes, confidence change |
| Action Plan | Homework, commitments, follow-up items, next session focus |
| Relationship | Rapport level (1-10), trust indicators, communication preferences, effective/ineffective approaches |
| Next Session | CliffsNotes summary, where we left off, recommended focus, questions to explore, techniques to try, things to avoid |

**SOAP Notes Generation:**
- **Subjective:** Client's self-reported feelings, concerns, goals in their own words
- **Objective:** Observable behaviors, tone, engagement level, measurable data
- **Assessment:** Clinical impression, progress evaluation, patterns observed
- **Plan:** Next steps, homework, follow-up items, recommended focus

### Pre-Session CliffsNotes

Before each voice coaching session, coaches now see:

```
🎯 QUICK SUMMARY (2-3 sentences)
What's the essential context the coach needs to know?

📍 WHERE WE LEFT OFF
- Last session's main topic
- Any unfinished business
- Outstanding action items

💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM HISTORY
- What works for this client
- What doesn't work
- Known triggers to avoid
- Communication preferences

🎯 RECOMMENDED FOCUS
- Suggested topic for this session
- Questions to explore
- Techniques that might help

⚠️ WATCH FOR
- Any risk indicators
- Patterns to monitor
- Things the client might be avoiding

🌟 CELEBRATE
- Recent wins to acknowledge
- Progress to highlight
- Strengths to reinforce
```

| `sessionProfileExtraction.getClientProfile` | Get full client profile with all extracted data |
| `sessionProfileExtraction.getSessionHistory` | Get session history with summaries |

## CHANGELOG: Memphis Soulful Singing Coach (December 19, 2025)

### World-Class Vocal Training for Teddy Swims, Chris Stapleton, Jelly Roll Style

**Problem Identified:** The previous singing coach was too generic. User wanted a specialized coach that could teach the soulful, raspy, powerful vocal style of artists like Teddy Swims, Chris Stapleton, and Jelly Roll - taking someone from zero to hero.

**Research Conducted:**
- Teddy Swims vocal technique (mix voice, gritty onset, soulful baritone)
- Chris Stapleton vocal technique (twang, power, country-soul)
- Jelly Roll vocal technique (raw authenticity, emotional dynamics)
- Safe rasp/grit techniques (false cord, vocal fry, gritty onset)
- Professional vocal coaching best practices

### Solution: Memphis - The Soulful Singing Coach

**Coach Identity:**
- **Name:** Memphis
- **Specialty:** Soulful, powerful singing (Teddy Swims, Chris Stapleton, Jelly Roll style)
- **Philosophy:** "Anyone can learn to sing with soul. It's not about having a 'gift' - it's about learning the techniques, building the foundation, and then letting go."

### Zero-to-Hero Curriculum

| Phase | Focus | Key Techniques |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | Breath support, natural voice, pitch accuracy | Diaphragmatic breathing, hissing exercise, pitch matching |
| **Phase 2: Building Blocks** | Chest voice, mix voice, twang | "Mum mum mum" scales, "Nay nay nay" slides, "Meow" twang exercise |
| **Phase 3: Adding Soul** | Safe rasp/grit, gritty onset, dynamics | Vocal fry, false cord technique, "HUH!" onset, whisper-to-explosion |
| **Phase 4: Artist-Specific** | Teddy Swims, Chris Stapleton, Jelly Roll styles | Song-specific training, style techniques |

### Artist-Specific Training

**Teddy Swims Style:**
- Mix voice and smooth transitions
- Gritty onsets on emotional peaks
- R&B runs and riffs
- Practice song: "Lose Control"

**Chris Stapleton Style:**
- Heavy chest voice with twang
- Growly tone on sustained notes
- Volume as emotion
- Practice song: "Tennessee Whiskey"

**Jelly Roll Style:**
- Raw, unpolished authenticity
- Storytelling through dynamics
- Rasp on emotional peaks only
- Practice song: "Save Me"

### Safety Features Built In

- **Rasp Safety:** "If it hurts, STOP. Good rasp feels buzzy and effortless. Bad rasp feels scratchy and strained."
- **Practice Limits:** Rasp practice limited to 5 minutes max when learning
- **Tension Detection:** Coach detects and addresses vocal tension immediately
- **Rest Reminders:** "Rest days are as important as practice days."

### Warm-Up Routine (Every Session)

1. Lip trills (brrrrr) - wakes up voice without strain
2. Sirens - low to high, back down
3. Humming on scales - feel the buzz
4. "Mum mum mum" going down - chest voice activation
5. "Hey!" calls - power activation

### Deployment

Commit: `338c8f5` - "Add world-class soulful singing coach 'Memphis'"
Pushed to GitHub, Render auto-deploying.

### Testing Instructions

1. Go to Control Center → Real-Time Voice Coach

   - "Can you teach me Tennessee Whiskey?"
5. Notice the coach:
   - Starts with foundation (breath support)
   - Teaches specific techniques with exercises
   - References your favorite artists
   - Prioritizes vocal health and safety
