## THE 4 GOLDEN RULES

1. **READ THIS ENTIRE GUIDE** before touching any code
2. **USE PROFILEGUARD** in any code that touches user data
3. **DO NOT REBUILD** - check the feature list first
4. **FIX REVENUE BLOCKERS** before anything else

---

## ANSWERS TO GATE QUESTIONS

> **1. What is ProfileGuard?**  
> ProfileGuard is the central system that loads unified client context (name, preferences, history, goals) for EVERY user interaction. It ensures we NEVER forget a client. All user-facing modules MUST call `ProfileGuard.getClientContext()` to maintain continuity.

> **2. Features already built (there are 50+, here are key ones):**  
> AI Coach (Sage), Real-Time Voice Coach, Sleep Stories, Focus Coach, AI Meditation, Structured Programs, Goals System, Habit Tracking, Health Optimization, Daily Check-ins, Coaching Dashboard, Live Session Assistant, Speaker Training, Compliance System, Crisis Detection

> **3. What happens if you rebuild something?**  
> You waste time, introduce bugs, break integrations with ProfileGuard, potentially take down the live platform, and lose the owner's trust and revenue.

**Now state your answers and this confirmation:**
> "I have read MASTER_GUIDE.md. ProfileGuard is mandatory. I will not rebuild existing features. I understand this is a live platform with real users."

# PART 1: FOUNDATIONAL VISION {#foundational-vision}

# PART 2: GUIDING PRINCIPLES {#guiding-principles}

## 🔴 **MANDATORY RULES FOR DEVELOPMENT** 🔴

1.  **READ FIRST, CODE SECOND.** Do not assume a feature is missing. Verify its existence in this guide. The platform is more complete than you think.
2.  **NO REBUILDING.** The existing systems are built on specific, evidence-based principles. Do not "improve" or "refactor" working code without explicit instruction. Focus on the requested task only.
3.  **REVENUE IS PARAMOUNT.** This is a business. Fix revenue-blocking bugs with the highest priority. All other tasks are secondary.
4.  **PROFILEGUARD IS SACRED.** The `ProfileGuard` system is the central nervous system of this platform. It ensures we **never forget a client**. All new features that interact with a user **MUST** integrate with `ProfileGuard` to maintain client context and continuity. No exceptions.

## Core Operating Philosophy

1. **Evidence-Based Only:** Only empirical research matters. Level A/B evidence (RCTs, meta-analyses) accepted. Everything else is filtered out by Truth Keepers.

2. **Self-Learning Systems:** Every module must:
   - Track its own effectiveness
   - Learn from client outcomes
   - Update itself with new research
   - Evolve toward what clients actually need

3. **Platform-Wide Intelligence:** The platform aggregates ALL data from ALL modules across ALL clients to:
   - Detect patterns and trends
   - Generate insights and recommendations
   - Move perpetually toward serving clients better

4. **One-and-Done:** Don't rebuild what's built properly. Focus effort on missing features, not polish of existing excellence.

5. **Revenue Blockers First:** Fix what blocks revenue before aesthetic improvements.

# PART 5: ARCHITECTURE {#architecture}

- **Frontend:** React (Vite) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Node.js with tRPC for API routes.
- **Database:** MySQL on PlanetScale (serverless).
- **Hosting:** Render (auto-deploys from `main` branch).
- **Authentication:** Custom JWT-based system.
- **Payments:** Stripe.
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI (GPT-4o, Realtime API, TTS), custom models for analysis.

## **ProfileGuard Architecture**

**This is the most important system in the platform.** It is the "brain" that remembers everything about a client.

- **`ProfileGuard.ts`:** The central module.
- **Unified Client Profile:** A single, comprehensive data model that aggregates information from all other modules.
- **How it Works:**
    1. Before any procedure that interacts with a user, `ProfileGuard.getClientContext()` **MUST** be called.
    2. This loads the complete client history, preferences, goals, challenges, and interaction patterns.
    3. This context is then used to personalize the AI's response, ensuring the platform feels continuous and intelligent.
    4. All new interactions are logged back to the Unified Client Profile via `SelfLearning.extractAndUpdateClientProfile()`.

**Any new feature MUST integrate with ProfileGuard. Failure to do so breaks the core value proposition of the platform.**
