## Overview

Chase Hughes developed the Six-Minute X-Ray (SMX) system based on military intelligence work and 10 years of research. The system allows rapid behavior profiling to gain deep insight into who someone really is based on their behavior, speech, and mannerisms.

## Core Components

### 1. Social Needs Assessment

**Six Social Needs (everyone has TWO of these):**

1. **Need to feel important** → Fear of being dismissed/mocked
2. **Need for approval** → Fear of rejection/disdain
3. **Need for acceptance** → Fear of criticism/alienation
4. **Need to be perceived as intelligent** → Fear of being seen as dumb
5. **Need to be pitied** → Fear of being ignored/disbelieved
6. **Need to be perceived as powerful** → Fear of being disrespected/challenged

**Observable Indicators:**
- Appearance (expensive clothing, status symbols)
- Behavior patterns (people-pleasing, loud talking)
- Stories they tell (leadership stories, validation seeking)
- Social interactions (how they relate to others)

### 2. Decision-Making Style

**Six Decision-Making Factors:**

1. **Deviance** - Decisions to stand out from crowd
2. **Novelty** - Decisions for new experiences/trendsetting
3. **Social image** - Decisions to be viewed positively
4. **Conformity** - Decisions to blend in with peers
5. **Investment** - Decisions for maximum ROI
6. **Necessity** - Decisions for practical material needs

**Key Insight:** Most people align with 2+ factors, often adjacent in the list.

## Application to Coaching Platform

### For Live Session Assistant AI

**What to Observe:**
- Social need indicators in client behavior
- Decision-making patterns in conversation
- Fear responses and triggers
- Rapport building opportunities
- Influence points for behavioral change

**AI Prompts to Generate:**
- "Client showing need for approval - validate their progress"
- "Decision-making style: Investment - frame goals as ROI"
- "Fear of criticism detected - create safe space before feedback"
- "Conformity motivation - reference peer success stories"

### Integration Strategy

1. **During Session:**
   - AI observes video/audio for social need indicators
   - Tracks decision-making language patterns
   - Identifies fears being expressed
   - Generates real-time coaching prompts

2. **Post-Session:**
   - Behavior profile summary for coach
   - Recommended approaches for next session
   - Tracking changes over time

## Limitations for Our Use

**Important Notes:**
- SMX is designed for rapid profiling (6 minutes)
- Our coaching sessions are longer (30-60 minutes)
- We need deeper, holistic assessment beyond social needs
- Must integrate with spiritual, emotional, physical dimensions

**Next Research Needed:**
- Paul Ekman facial expressions (emotional dimension)
- Body language research (physical dimension)
- Spiritual wellness indicators (spiritual dimension)
- Mental health assessment frameworks (mental dimension)

## Key Takeaways

1. ✅ Social needs framework is solid foundation
2. ✅ Decision-making styles useful for goal-setting
3. ✅ Observable indicators can be programmed into AI
4. ⚠️ Need to expand beyond influence/rapport to holistic wellness
5. ⚠️ Must add emotional, spiritual, physical dimensions
