## NOTES

- ICF (International Coach Federation) is the gold standard but takes 6+ months
- For immediate credibility, the quick certifications work fine
- Your PLATFORM credentials (AI trained on Ekman, Hughes, etc.) are separate from YOUR personal credentials
- Many successful coaches have minimal formal credentials - results and testimonials matter more
