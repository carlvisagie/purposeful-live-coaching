# Landing Page Best Practices Research

## Source: Unbounce (Industry Leader in Landing Pages)

### 11 Essential Best Practices

1. **Message Match** - Headline must match the ad that brought them there
2. **Above the Fold** - CTA, headline, and value prop must be visible without scrolling
3. **Directional Cues** - Use arrows, shapes, images to guide eye to CTA
4. **Show Product in Action** - Demo videos, screenshots, real context
5. **Remove Navigation** - No distractions, single conversion goal
6. **Authentic Social Proof** - Real names, photos, video testimonials
7. **Clear, Compelling Copy** - Simple, readable, bulleted lists
8. **Keep it Fast** - Under 3 seconds load time (70% of consumers leave if slow)
9. **Mobile-First Design** - 83% of landing page visits are mobile!
10. **A/B Test Everything** - Data over gut instinct
11. **Use Templates** - Start with proven designs

### Design Best Practices

1. **White Space** - Give content room to breathe
2. **Visual Hierarchy** - Guide visitors through content naturally
3. **Mobile-First** - Design for phones first, then desktop
4. **High-Quality Images** - Real product shots, not generic stock

### Lead Gen Specific

1. **Multi-Step Forms** - Break long forms into steps
2. **Reduce Manual Entry** - Use dropdowns, checkboxes
3. **Privacy Policy** - Required by GDPR, builds trust

### Key Stats

- **83% of landing page visits are on mobile devices** (2024)
- **70% of consumers leave if page takes >3 seconds to load**
- Pages with single CTA convert higher than multiple CTAs



## CTA Button Color Research (CXL)

### Key Finding: NO SINGLE COLOR IS BEST

**The color of the button has little-to-no effect on its own. What matters is:**
1. How it changes the visual hierarchy of the page
2. How it makes the CTA stand out from the rest of the design
3. CONTRAST is what matters, not the specific color

### Case Studies Summary

| Test | Result | Lift |
|------|--------|------|
| Red vs Green | Red won | +34% |
| Red vs Green (HubSpot) | Red won | +21% |
| Red vs White/Green | Red won | +5% |
| Orange vs Blue | Blue won | +9% |

### The Real Lesson

> "More often than not, these tests reveal that previously there was no button, or the button is just much more prominent. It stands out from the rest of the page and converts better because it's a HIGH-CONTRAST color, not any single color."

### Popular CTA Colors (Ed Leake study of 90 high-converting buttons)
1. Orange
2. Blue
3. Red
4. Green

### Psychology of Colors

| Color | Association |
|-------|-------------|
| **Red** | Urgency, excitement, passion |
| **Orange** | Confidence, enthusiasm, action |
| **Green** | Trust, approval, "go" signal |
| **Blue** | Trust, security, reliability |
| **Yellow** | Happiness, attention-grabbing |
| **Purple** | Luxury, creativity |

### Key Takeaway for Our Platform

**The big purple button worked because:**
1. Purple = luxury, premium feel (matches coaching)
2. High contrast against the page background
3. Large size = impossible to miss
4. Clear action text

**We should bring back the BIG PURPLE BUTTON but ensure:**
- Maximum contrast with background
- Large, impossible-to-miss size
- Clear, action-oriented text
- Above the fold placement
