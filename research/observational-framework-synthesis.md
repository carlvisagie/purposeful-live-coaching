# Purposeful Live Coaching - Observational Framework
## Comprehensive Synthesis for AI-Assisted Video Coaching

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 11, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define what the AI observes during video coaching sessions to provide real-time coaching prompts

---

## FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

This framework integrates research from multiple disciplines to create a proprietary holistic observational system for AI-assisted coaching. The AI analyzes video/audio streams during live coaching sessions and generates real-time prompts for the human coach.

**Core Principle:** Holistic wellness requires assessment across ALL dimensions simultaneously - spiritual, mental, emotional, physical, and social.

## DIMENSION 1: EMOTIONAL HEALTH (Ekman)

### Foundation: Seven Universal Emotions

**Research Base:** Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System (FACS)

**Observable Indicators:**

1. **Anger** - Furrowed brows, tightened lips, jaw clenching
2. **Contempt** - Unilateral lip corner raise, asymmetric expression
3. **Disgust** - Nose wrinkle, upper lip raise, lowered brows
4. **Enjoyment** - Genuine smile (Duchenne), crow's feet, raised cheeks
5. **Fear** - Wide eyes, raised eyebrows, open mouth
6. **Sadness** - Drooping eyelids, downturned mouth corners, lowered gaze
7. **Surprise** - Raised eyebrows, wide eyes, dropped jaw

**Key Concepts:**

- **Emotion Families:** Each emotion has variations (anger includes irritation, frustration, rage)
- **Micro-expressions:** Brief involuntary expressions (1/25 to 1/5 second) revealing concealed emotions
- **Duration:** Emotions last < 1 hour; longer = mood or disorder
- **Emotional Congruence:** Does facial expression match verbal content?

**AI Analysis Tasks:**

- Detect seven universal emotions in real-time
- Identify micro-expressions revealing concealed emotions
- Track emotion duration (flag if > 1 hour)
- Assess emotional congruence (face vs words)
- Map emotional triggers (what topics trigger which emotions)
- Evaluate emotional awareness (does client recognize their emotions?)

**Coaching Prompts Generated:**

- "Client showing anger - explore trigger and underlying need"
- "Micro-expression of fear detected when discussing [topic] - create safe space"
- "Enjoyment emerging - reinforce this positive pattern"
- "Emotional incongruence - facial expression doesn't match words, explore discrepancy"
- "Sadness persisting beyond normal duration - assess for depression"
- "Client unaware of emotional pattern - reflect back observation"

## INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK

### How Dimensions Interact

**Key Principle:** All dimensions are interconnected. Changes in one dimension affect others.

**Examples:**

1. **Emotional → Physical:** Anxiety (emotional) → rapid breathing, tension (physical)
2. **Spiritual → Mental:** Loss of purpose (spiritual) → depression, hopelessness (mental)
3. **Physical → Emotional:** Chronic pain (physical) → irritability, sadness (emotional)
4. **Mental → Social:** Cognitive distortions (mental) → relationship conflicts (social)
5. **Social → Spiritual:** Isolation (social) → loss of meaning, disconnection (spiritual)

### AI Integration Strategy

**Real-Time Analysis:**

1. **Continuous monitoring** of all five dimensions simultaneously
2. **Pattern recognition** across dimensions (e.g., closed posture + fear + circular thinking)
3. **Trigger mapping** (what topics trigger which responses across dimensions)
4. **Longitudinal tracking** (how patterns change over time)
5. **Prompt generation** based on multi-dimensional assessment

**Prompt Priority System:**

1. **Safety concerns** (suicidal ideation, severe distress) - IMMEDIATE
2. **Breakthrough opportunities** (openness, readiness for change) - HIGH
3. **Pattern interruptions** (stuck patterns, resistance) - MEDIUM
4. **Reinforcement** (positive patterns, progress) - ONGOING
5. **Observations** (neutral data points) - LOW

**Coach Interface:**

- Real-time prompts appear on coach's screen
- Color-coded by priority (red=safety, green=opportunity, yellow=pattern, blue=reinforcement)
- Coach can accept, dismiss, or modify prompts
- AI learns from coach's responses to improve future prompts

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Video Analysis

**Frame Rate:** 30 FPS minimum for micro-expression detection

**Resolution:** 720p minimum for facial detail

**Analysis Frequency:**
- Facial expressions: Every frame (30x/second)
- Body language: Every 2 seconds
- Overall assessment: Every 30 seconds

**AI Models Required:**

1. **Facial Recognition:** Identify and track face in frame
2. **FACS Detection:** Map facial action units to emotions
3. **Micro-expression Detection:** Identify brief expressions (< 200ms)
4. **Body Pose Estimation:** Track posture, gestures, movement
5. **Speech Analysis:** Transcribe and analyze verbal content
6. **Integration Model:** Synthesize multi-dimensional data into prompts

### Data Storage

**Per Session:**
- Video recording (optional, with consent)
- Emotion timeline (emotion detected at each timestamp)
- Body language timeline (posture, energy, tension at intervals)
- Trigger map (topics → emotional/physical responses)
- Coaching prompts generated and coach responses
- Session summary with dimensional assessments

**Longitudinal:**
- Pattern tracking across sessions
- Progress indicators by dimension
- Trigger evolution (what triggers change over time)
- Effectiveness metrics (which prompts led to breakthroughs)

### Privacy and Ethics

**Critical Requirements:**

1. **Informed Consent:** Clients must explicitly consent to video analysis
2. **Transparency:** Clients know AI is observing and generating prompts
3. **Coach Authority:** Coach makes final decisions, not AI
4. **Data Security:** Encrypted storage, HIPAA-compliant if applicable
5. **No Diagnosis:** AI provides observations, not clinical diagnoses
6. **Right to Opt-Out:** Clients can decline video analysis and use audio-only
