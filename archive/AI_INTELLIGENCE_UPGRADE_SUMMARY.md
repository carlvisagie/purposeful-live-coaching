---

## ✅ What Was Upgraded

### 1. Advanced Psychological Frameworks

**Added 9 evidence-based therapeutic approaches:**

| Framework | Application | Example Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **CBT** (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) | Identify thought patterns, challenge cognitive distortions | "Your thought 'I'm a failure' is an all-or-nothing distortion" |
| **ACT** (Acceptance & Commitment Therapy) | Psychological flexibility, values clarification | "What matters most to you? Let's align actions with values" |
| **DBT** (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) | Emotion regulation, distress tolerance | "Use TIPP skill: Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing" |
| **IFS** (Internal Family Systems) | Parts work, self-leadership | "The part of you that procrastinates is trying to protect you from failure" |
| **Polyvagal Theory** | Nervous system regulation | "Your vagus nerve is stuck in fight-or-flight. Let's activate rest-and-digest" |
| **Attachment Theory** | Relationship patterns | "This anxious attachment pattern shows up in how you seek validation" |
| **Motivational Interviewing** | Explore ambivalence | "What would change if you stayed exactly where you are for 5 more years?" |
| **Habit Formation Science** | Implementation intentions, environment design | "We'll use habit stacking: After coffee, immediately open your project" |
| **Neuroplasticity** | Brain rewiring through practice | "Your brain is creating new neural pathways with each repetition" |

**Impact:** AI now demonstrates deep psychological knowledge, not just generic advice.

### 2. Three Response Modes

**Before:** Always used same rigid structure (PLAN/OUTPUT/RUN/TEST/NEXT)  
**After:** Chooses from 3 modes based on context

#### MODE 1: STRUCTURED PROTOCOL
**When:** New problems, crisis, overwhelm  
**Format:**
- PLAN: Why and intent
- OUTPUT: Exact protocol/framework
- RUN/USE: Step-by-step execution
- TEST/VALIDATE: Success markers
- NEXT: Next logical step

**Example:** User says "I'm anxious and can't sleep"  
→ Provides 4-7-8 breathing protocol with exact instructions

#### MODE 2: SOCRATIC EXPLORATION
**When:** Self-discovery, values clarification, complex decisions  
**Format:**
- Ask 2-3 powerful questions
- Let user discover their own answers
- Synthesize into clear path forward

**Example Questions:**
- "What would it look like if this problem were solved?"
- "What's the real cost of staying where you are?"
- "If you knew you couldn't fail, what would you do?"

**Example:** User says "Should I quit my job?"  
→ Asks questions to help them clarify values before recommending action

#### MODE 3: CONVERSATIONAL COACHING
**When:** Follow-ups, check-ins, progress reviews  
**Format:**
- Natural dialogue
- References previous conversations
- Acknowledges progress
- Adjusts based on feedback

**Example:** User returns after trying a protocol  
→ "Last time you mentioned the 4-7-8 breathing. How did that work for you? Let's adjust based on what happened."

**Impact:** Conversations feel natural, not robotic. AI adapts to relationship depth.

---

### 3. Conversation Context Tracking

**Before:** Treated every message as standalone  
**After:** Detects message count and adjusts approach

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const messageCount = data.messages.length;
const isFirstMessage = messageCount === 0;
const isFollowUp = messageCount >= 2;

if (isFirstMessage) {
  // Use MODE 1 to establish trust
} else if (isFollowUp) {
  // Use MODE 3 to show continuity
}
```

**Impact:** 
- First message → Structured protocol (builds trust)
- Follow-up messages → Conversational (shows memory)
- References previous topics naturally

---

### 4. Real-World Examples & Analogies

**Added instruction to use relatable scenarios:**

**Examples:**
- "I worked with someone who struggled with the same pattern. Here's what shifted it..."
- "This is similar to how elite athletes handle performance anxiety..."
- "Think of it like debugging code—you isolate the variable causing the error"

**Impact:** Abstract psychological concepts become concrete and actionable.

---

### 5. Less Robotic Language

**Before:**
- Always formal
- Same phrases repeated
- Predictable structure

**After:**
- "Vary your language—don't sound formulaic"
- "Balance masculine authority with genuine warmth"
- "Precision and calm, but not robotic"

**Impact:** Feels like talking to a human expert, not a chatbot.

---

### 6. Named Framework Usage

**Before:** Used techniques without explaining them  
**After:** Names the framework so users understand the science

**Example:**
- "Using **Polyvagal Theory**, we'll activate your parasympathetic nervous system..."
- "This is **Cognitive Defusion** from ACT—separating yourself from your thoughts..."
- "We're applying **Implementation Intentions** from habit science..."

**Impact:** Users learn psychological concepts while getting help. Educational + actionable.
