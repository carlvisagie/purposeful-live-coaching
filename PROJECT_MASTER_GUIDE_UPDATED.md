## 📝 RECENT FIXES & UPDATES

### December 10, 2025 - Manus OAuth Removal (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem:** Pricing page "Get Started" button was redirecting to Manus OAuth login instead of Stripe checkout.

**Root Cause:**
1. `getLoginUrl()` function generating Manus OAuth URLs
2. Global error interceptor in `main.tsx` redirecting ALL errors to OAuth
3. `getMySubscription` query on Pricing page causing 401 errors for guests

**Solution Implemented:**

**Commit 639e715:** "CRITICAL FIX: Remove ALL Manus OAuth code"
- ✅ Removed `getLoginUrl()` function from `client/src/const.ts`
- ✅ Replaced with simple `LOGIN_URL = '/login'` constant
- ✅ Removed `redirectToLoginIfUnauthorized()` from `client/src/main.tsx`
- ✅ Removed OAuth error interceptors that were blocking guest checkout
- ✅ Updated all 7 components using `getLoginUrl()` to use `LOGIN_URL`
- ✅ Files modified:
  * `client/src/const.ts`
  * `client/src/main.tsx`
  * `client/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`
  * `client/src/pages/AICoach.tsx`
  * `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
  * `client/src/pages/EmotionTracker.tsx`
  * `client/src/pages/InsightsDashboard.tsx`

**Commit 50d6dc0:** "Fix: Disable getMySubscription query on Pricing page for guest users"
- ✅ Disabled `getMySubscription` query on Pricing page
- ✅ Prevents 401 errors for non-authenticated users
- ✅ Guest checkout now works without authentication

**Impact:**
- ✅ Frontend is now 100% Manus-free
- ✅ Guest users can access pricing page
- ✅ "Get Started" button works without login
- ✅ No more OAuth redirects
- ✅ Platform is fully independent

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to production (waiting for Render to complete build)

**Documentation Updated:**
- `MANUS_OAUTH_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `MANUS_CODE_REMOVAL_PLAN.md` - Removal plan and checklist
- `PROJECT_MASTER_GUIDE_UPDATED.md` - This file

### December 10, 2025 - AI Coach LLM Fix

**Problem:** AI Coach was using `gemini-2.5-flash` (Manus default) instead of user's OpenAI API.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Changed model from `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gpt-4o` in `server/lib/llm.ts`
- ✅ Fixed PostgreSQL syntax bugs (`.insertId` → `.id`, added `.returning()`)
- ✅ Fixed guest user support (conditional `userId` insertion)
- ✅ AI Coach now generates responses using GPT-4o with user's OPENAI_API_KEY

**Commit:** d7e8a38 "Fix AI Coach: Change model from gemini-2.5-flash to gpt-4o"

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and working in production

### December 10, 2025 - Pricing Tier Improvements (4 commits)

**Problem:** Elite tier didn't show clear value over Professional tier. Wording made Professional seem like better deal.

**Commit 8ff43f5:** "Make Elite tier clearly superior - Custom and 24/7 phone exclusive"
- ✅ AI Elite: "Custom coaching" → "Comprehensive wellness plans" (Custom reserved for Human Elite)
- ✅ Professional: "phone support" → "phone support (business hours)"
- ✅ Elite: "phone support (priority)" → "phone support (24/7 priority)"

**Commit d706948:** "Make phone support realistic - no 24/7 human coach claims"
- ✅ Professional: "Email & scheduled phone consultations" (realistic)
- ✅ Elite: "24/7 AI + priority coach texting" (not false 24/7 human)
- ✅ Elite: "Email, text & priority phone access" (no false promises)

**Commit f2386be:** "Make Elite tier significantly more compelling"
- ✅ Added "Quarterly family wellness workshops (4x per year)"
- ✅ Added "Annual comprehensive wellness assessment"
- ✅ Added "Lifetime access to all resources & recordings"

**Impact:**
- ✅ Elite now clearly worth the extra $800/month
- ✅ No false 24/7 human coach promises
- ✅ Clear value hierarchy: Basic → Premium → Elite
- ✅ Custom features exclusive to Elite
- ✅ Realistic expectations set

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to production

- ✅ Fixed authentication issues (removed `?authPlugin=mysql_native_password`)
- ✅ Created AI Chat tables in production (aiChatConversations, aiChatMessages, aiInsights)

**Discovery:**
- ✅ 63+ tRPC procedures already built
- ✅ 20 database tables in production
- ✅ 31 routers fully implemented
- ✅ Scheduling, sessions, files, subscriptions ALL exist
- ✅ Nobody checked before creating mock data!

**Solution:**

- ✅ Client Dashboard: Connected to real scheduling/files/subscriptions
- ✅ Coach Dashboard: Connected to real sessions/clients/stats
- ✅ Replaced ALL empty arrays with real tRPC queries
- ✅ Re-enabled subscription query with proper auth check

**Commit:** ff882bc "Connect dashboards to real backend procedures"
