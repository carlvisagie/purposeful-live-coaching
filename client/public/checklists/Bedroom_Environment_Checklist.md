### Bedroom Environment Checklist

*   [ ] **Dark:** Is your bedroom dark enough? Use blackout curtains or an eye mask to block out light.
*   [ ] **Quiet:** Is your bedroom quiet enough? Use earplugs or a white noise machine to block out noise.
*   [ ] **Cool:** Is your bedroom cool enough? The ideal temperature for sleep is between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 and 19 degrees Celsius).
*   [ ] **Comfortable:** Is your bed comfortable? Make sure your mattress and pillows are supportive and comfortable.
*   [ ] **No screens:** Are there any screens in your bedroom? The blue light from screens can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, a hormone that helps you to sleep. Remove all screens from your bedroom, or at least turn them off an hour before bed.
*   [ ] **No clutter:** Is your bedroom free of clutter? A cluttered bedroom can be a source of stress and anxiety.
*   [ ] **Relaxing:** Is your bedroom a relaxing place to be? Use calming colors, soft lighting, and aromatherapy to create a relaxing atmosphere.
