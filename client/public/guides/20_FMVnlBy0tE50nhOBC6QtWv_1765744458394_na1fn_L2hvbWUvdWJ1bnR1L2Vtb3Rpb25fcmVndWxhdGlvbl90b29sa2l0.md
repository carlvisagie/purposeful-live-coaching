## 2. Reducing Emotional Vulnerability: The P.L.E.A.S.E. Skill

The most effective way to manage intense emotions is to reduce your vulnerability to them in the first place. This skill, adapted from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), focuses on taking care of your physical body, which is intrinsically linked to your emotional state.

| Element | Description | Action Step | Tracking (Check when complete) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P**hysical **I**llness | Treat physical illness and pain immediately. See a doctor when necessary. | [ ] Schedule a check-up or take prescribed medication. | [ ] |
| **L**imits | Balance your life by setting realistic limits and boundaries. | [ ] Say "No" to one non-essential request this week. | [ ] |
| **E**ating | Eat balanced, nutritious meals regularly. Avoid skipping meals. | [ ] Plan and eat three balanced meals today. | [ ] |
| **A**void Mood-Altering Drugs | Avoid non-prescribed drugs and excessive alcohol. | [ ] Commit to sobriety or moderation for the next 7 days. | [ ] |
| **S**leep | Get an adequate amount of sleep (7-9 hours for most adults). | [ ] Go to bed and wake up at the same time for 3 days. | [ ] |
| **E**xercise | Engage in regular, moderate exercise. | [ ] Take a 30-minute walk or do a light workout today. | [ ] |

## 3. Changing Unwanted Emotions: Check the Facts & Opposite Action

When an intense emotion arises, it is often triggered by an interpretation of an event, not the event itself. This two-step process helps you determine if your emotion fits the facts and, if not, how to change your response.

### Step 1: Check the Facts

Use this structured table to analyze the situation objectively.

| Question | Your Emotional Experience | Objective Facts (What a camera would record) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. What is the prompting event?** | *[Fill in]* | *[Fill in]* |
| **2. What is my primary emotion?** | *[Fill in]* | *[Fill in]* |
| **3. What are my thoughts/interpretations?** | *[Fill in]* | *[Fill in]* |
| **4. Does the intensity of my emotion fit the facts?** | *[Check one]* [ ] Yes [ ] No | *[Fill in]* |

### Step 2: Opposite Action

If your emotion **does not fit the facts** (e.g., intense fear when there is no actual danger), the goal is to act **opposite** to the emotion's action urge.

| Emotion | Action Urge | Opposite Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anger** | Attack, yell, criticize, withdraw | Gently avoid the person, be kind, validate their feelings. |
| **Fear** | Run away, hide, avoid | Approach, move forward, do what you are afraid of. |
| **Shame/Guilt** | Hide, avoid, apologize excessively | Publicly share your experience, make amends non-defensively. |
| **Sadness** | Isolate, stay in bed, withdraw | Get active, approach others, engage in pleasant activities. |

## 4. Crisis Management: The T.I.P.P. Skill

When emotions are at a 10/10 intensity and you need to bring them down fast to prevent destructive behavior, use these Distress Tolerance skills.

| Element | Technique | How to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T**emperature | **Change your body temperature.** | Splash cold water on your face, hold an ice pack, or take a cold shower for 30 seconds. This triggers the "dive reflex," which rapidly calms the nervous system. |
| **I**ntense Exercise | **Engage in intense, brief exercise.** | Do 10 burpees, run in place for 5 minutes, or sprint up a flight of stairs. This burns off the physical energy of the emotion. |
| **P**aced Breathing | **Slow your breathing.** | Slow your pace to 5-6 breaths per minute (inhale for 4, exhale for 6). Focus entirely on the sensation of the breath. |
| **P**aired Muscle Relaxation | **Tense and relax your muscles.** | Tense all the muscles in your body as hard as you can for 5 seconds, then immediately release the tension. Repeat 2-3 times. |

### Action Steps: Crisis Plan

**Write down your go-to T.I.P.P. strategy and commit to using it the next time your emotion reaches an 8/10 or higher.**
