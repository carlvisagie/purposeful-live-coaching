# Energy Drain Eliminator: A Structured Approach to Vitality

## Purpose

This worksheet is designed to help you systematically identify, categorize, and eliminate the key factors that deplete your energy, leading to increased vitality, focus, and overall well-being. It is grounded in the evidence-based framework of the four dimensions of energy management [1].

## Instructions

1.  **Understand the Four Dimensions:** Review the four types of energy drains (Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual) to better categorize your personal drains.
2.  **Identify and Rate:** In the table below, list your specific energy drains and rate their impact on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = minimal drain, 10 = completely exhausting).
3.  **Develop a Strategy:** Based on the dimension, brainstorm and record a specific, actionable strategy to reduce or eliminate each drain.
4.  **Track and Reflect:** Commit to implementing your strategies and use the reflection questions to guide your weekly review.

## The Four Dimensions of Energy Drains

Energy management is not just about physical rest; it involves four interconnected dimensions [2]:

| Dimension | Description of Drain | Example Drain | Elimination Strategy Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physical** | Poor sleep, inadequate nutrition, lack of exercise, chronic stress. | Skipping lunch to work; poor sleep hygiene. | Rest, nutrition, movement, and recovery. |
| **Emotional** | Negative emotions, toxic relationships, lack of appreciation, feeling undervalued. | Constant conflict with a colleague; suppressing anger. | Emotional regulation, boundary setting, and positive self-talk. |
| **Mental** | Information overload, multitasking, fragmented focus, unproductive work habits. | Checking email every 5 minutes; cluttered workspace. | Focus, clarity, single-tasking, and mental breaks. |
| **Spiritual** | Lack of purpose, misalignment between values and actions, feeling disconnected from one's life mission. | Working a job that contradicts core values. | Reconnecting with purpose, values clarification, and meaningful contribution. |
