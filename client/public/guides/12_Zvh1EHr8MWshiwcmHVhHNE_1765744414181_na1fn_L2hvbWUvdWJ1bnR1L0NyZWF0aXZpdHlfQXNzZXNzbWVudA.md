# Creativity Assessment: Unlocking Your Creative Potential

## Purpose and Instructions

This **Creativity Assessment** is designed to help you, the coaching client, gain a deeper understanding of your current creative strengths, identify potential blocks, and establish a clear path for creative development. It is grounded in established psychological models of creativity, focusing on both everyday (Little-c) and professional (Pro-c) creative behaviors [1].

**Instructions:**

1.  **Honesty is Key:** Answer each statement honestly, reflecting on your typical behavior over the past three months.
2.  **Use the Scale:** Rate each statement using the following 5-point scale:
    *   1 = Strongly Disagree
    *   2 = Disagree
    *   3 = Neutral
    *   4 = Agree
    *   5 = Strongly Agree
3.  **Calculate Your Score:** Sum the scores for each section to identify areas for growth.
