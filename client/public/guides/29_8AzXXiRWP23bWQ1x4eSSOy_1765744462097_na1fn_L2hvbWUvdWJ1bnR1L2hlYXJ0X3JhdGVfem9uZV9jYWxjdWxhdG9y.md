# Heart Rate Zone Calculator: Personalized Training Guide

**Material Name:** Heart Rate Zone Calculator
**Category:** Worksheet
**Author:** Manus AI for Purposeful Live Coaching

## Purpose and Instructions

This worksheet is designed to help you calculate your personalized heart rate training zones. Training within specific heart rate zones ensures you are working out at the right intensity to achieve your fitness goals, whether that is improving endurance, burning fat, or increasing speed.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Complete Section 1:** Measure and record your Age and Resting Heart Rate (RHR).
2.  **Complete Section 2:** Calculate your Maximum Heart Rate (HRmax) and Heart Rate Reserve (HRR).
3.  **Complete Section 3:** Use the Karvonen Formula to determine your personalized training zones.
4.  **Use Sections 4 & 5:** Apply your zones to your workouts and reflect on your progress.

## Section 1: Your Key Metrics

Please fill in the following fields to establish your baseline data.

| Metric | Your Value (BPM) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Your Age (Years)** | [ ] | Used for HRmax calculation. |
| **Resting Heart Rate (RHR)** | [ ] BPM | Measure first thing in the morning before getting out of bed. |

## Section 2: Calculate Your Heart Rate Reserve (HRR)

We will use the standard **Age-Predicted Maximum Heart Rate (HRmax)** formula and the **Heart Rate Reserve (HRR)**, which is the foundation for the more accurate Karvonen Method [4].

### Step 2.1: Maximum Heart Rate (HRmax)

The most common formula is **220 - Age**.

| Calculation | Formula | Your Result (BPM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maximum Heart Rate (HRmax)** | 220 - [Your Age] | [ ] BPM |

> **Note:** While simple, the 220-Age formula can be inaccurate for some individuals [2]. For a more precise measure, consider a lab test or the Tanaka formula: **208 - (0.7 x Age)** [3].

### Step 2.2: Heart Rate Reserve (HRR)

The HRR is the difference between your maximum and resting heart rates.

| Calculation | Formula | Your Result (BPM) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heart Rate Reserve (HRR)** | HRmax - RHR | [ ] BPM |

## Section 3: Your Personalized Heart Rate Training Zones

The **Karvonen Formula** uses your HRR to calculate a more personalized target heart rate (THR) for each zone:

$$\text{THR} = (\text{HRR} \times \text{Intensity \%}) + \text{RHR}$$

| Zone | Intensity (% of HRR) | Target Heart Rate Range (BPM) | Primary Training Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zone 1: Very Light** | 50% - 60% | [ ] - [ ] BPM | Recovery, warm-up, cool-down. Improves overall health. |
| **Zone 2: Light** | 60% - 70% | [ ] - [ ] BPM | **Fat Burning.** Improves basic endurance and metabolism. |
| **Zone 3: Moderate** | 70% - 80% | [ ] - [ ] BPM | **Aerobic Fitness.** Improves blood circulation and efficiency. |
| **Zone 4: Hard** | 80% - 90% | [ ] - [ ] BPM | **Anaerobic Threshold.** Increases maximum performance capacity. |
| **Zone 5: Maximum** | 90% - 100% | [ ] - [ ] BPM | **Peak Effort.** Used for short intervals, maximizes speed and power. |

## Section 4: Workout Tracking Table

Use this table to track your workouts and ensure you are training in the correct zone for your goals.

| Date | Activity | Duration | Avg. Heart Rate (BPM) | Target Zone Achieved | Notes & Feeling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

## Section 5: Reflection and Action Steps

### Reflection Questions

1.  How did training in your calculated zones feel compared to your previous workouts?
    [ ] (Fill-in field for reflection)

2.  Which zone do you find most challenging to maintain, and why?
    [ ] (Fill-in field for reflection)

3.  What adjustments do you need to make to your training schedule to better align with your heart rate zones?
    [ ] (Fill-in field for reflection)

### Action Steps (Checklist)

[ ] **Recalculate:** I will recalculate my RHR and zones every 4-6 weeks as my fitness improves.
[ ] **Goal Setting:** I will set a specific training goal for the next two weeks (e.g., "Spend 3 sessions in Zone 3").
[ ] **Equipment Check:** I will ensure my heart rate monitor is accurate and worn correctly for all sessions.
[ ] **Coach Check-in:** I will share my calculated zones and initial tracking data with my coach.
