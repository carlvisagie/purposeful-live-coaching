# Energy Audit Worksheet: Optimizing Your Home for Efficiency

**Material Name:** Energy Audit Worksheet
**Category:** Worksheet

## Purpose and Instructions

This **Energy Audit Worksheet** is a professional, evidence-based tool designed to help you systematically assess your home's energy consumption, identify areas of waste, and develop a prioritized action plan for efficiency improvements. By completing this audit, you will gain clarity on where your energy dollars are going and how to make cost-effective changes.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Preparation:** Choose a time when you can dedicate 60-90 minutes to a thorough walk-through of your home. Have a flashlight, a pen, and this worksheet ready.
2.  **Execution:** Follow the steps in the checklist below, inspecting each area and recording your findings in the tables.
3.  **Analysis:** Complete the reflection questions to synthesize your data.
4.  **Action:** Transfer your highest-impact findings to the Action Plan table.

## Section 1: The Energy Audit Checklist

### 1.1. Building Shell and Air Leaks

Air leaks are a major source of energy loss, often accounting for 10% to 20% of heating and cooling costs [1]. Use the back of your hand or a lit incense stick to check for drafts in the following areas.

| Area to Inspect | Finding (Draft/No Draft) | Recommended Action | Action Priority (High/Med/Low) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Windows:** Edges, frames, and where the sash meets the frame. | [Fill in details] | [ ] Apply weatherstripping or caulk. | [ ] |
| **Doors:** Around the frame and under the door. | [Fill in details] | [ ] Install a door sweep or adjust the threshold. | [ ] |
| **Electrical Outlets/Switches:** On exterior walls. | [Fill in details] | [ ] Install foam gaskets behind plates. | [ ] |
| **Utility Penetrations:** Where pipes, vents, or cables enter the home. | [Fill in details] | [ ] Seal gaps with caulk or expanding foam. | [ ] |
| **Attic Hatch/Knee Walls:** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Add insulation and weatherstripping to the hatch. | [ ] |

### 1.2. Heating, Cooling, and Water Systems

These systems are typically the largest energy consumers in a home. Proper maintenance and settings are crucial for efficiency [2].

| System Component | Current Status/Setting | Efficiency Check | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Thermostat Type** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Is it a programmable or smart thermostat? | [ ] Upgrade to a programmable/smart model. |
| **Furnace/AC Filter** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Has the filter been changed in the last 3 months? | [ ] Change/clean the filter. |
| **Water Heater Temp.** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Is the temperature set to 120°F (49°C) or lower? | [ ] Lower the temperature setting. |
| **Ductwork** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Are there visible leaks or uninsulated sections in unconditioned spaces (attic/crawlspace)? | [ ] Seal and insulate ducts. |

### 1.3. Lighting and Appliances

Small changes in lighting and appliance use can lead to significant cumulative savings [3].

| Item | Current Status | Efficiency Check | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top 5 Used Fixtures** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Are all bulbs in these fixtures ENERGY STAR certified LEDs? | [ ] Replace with ENERGY STAR LEDs. |
| **Refrigerator** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Is the door seal tight (test with a dollar bill)? | [ ] Replace or repair the door seal. |
| **Laundry** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Do you wash most loads in cold water? | [ ] Switch to cold water for most loads. |
| **Electronics** | [Fill in details] | [ ] Are "phantom loads" (devices drawing power when off) managed with power strips? | [ ] Use smart or switchable power strips. |

## Section 2: Reflection and Analysis

Use your findings from the checklist to reflect on your home's energy profile.

1.  **The "Biggest Offender":** Based on your audit, which area of your home (Building Shell, HVAC, or Appliances) appears to be the single largest source of energy waste?
    > [Fill in your reflection here]

2.  **Low-Hanging Fruit:** What are the top three **low-cost/no-cost** actions you can take immediately (e.g., changing a filter, lowering the water heater temperature, sealing a draft)?
    > 1. [Fill in action]
    > 2. [Fill in action]
    > 3. [Fill in action]

3.  **Investment Opportunities:** What is one larger, higher-cost improvement (e.g., replacing an old appliance, adding insulation, upgrading a thermostat) that you believe will offer the best long-term return on investment?

## Section 3: Action Steps and Tracking

Transfer your top-priority items from the audit tables and reflection to this final action plan.

| Action Step (Be Specific) | Estimated Cost | Estimated Annual Savings | Target Completion Date | [ ] Completed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Example: Seal drafts around the front door with a new door sweep. | $25 | $40 | [Fill in date] | [ ] |
| 1. [Fill in action] | [Fill in cost] | [Fill in savings] | [Fill in date] | [ ] |
| 2. [Fill in action] | [Fill in cost] | [Fill in savings] | [Fill in date] | [ ] |
| 3. [Fill in action] | [Fill in cost] | [Fill in savings] | [Fill in date] | [ ] |
| 4. [Fill in action] | [Fill in cost] | [Fill in savings] | [Fill in date] | [ ] |
