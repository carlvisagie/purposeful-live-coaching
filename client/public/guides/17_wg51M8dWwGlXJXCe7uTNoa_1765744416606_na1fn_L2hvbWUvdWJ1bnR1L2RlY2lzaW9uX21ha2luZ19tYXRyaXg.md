# The Evidence-Based Decision-Making Matrix: A Coaching Template

**Material Name:** Decision-Making Matrix
**Category:** Template

## Introduction and Purpose

Making significant life and business decisions can be overwhelming, often leading to analysis paralysis or reliance on emotional, rather than rational, factors. The **Decision-Making Matrix**, also known as the Pugh Matrix or Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tool, provides a structured, evidence-based framework for evaluating complex choices. By assigning weights to criteria and objectively scoring each option, this template helps you minimize cognitive bias and maximize the probability of a successful outcome [1].

This template is designed to be immediately usable, guiding you from defining your dilemma to committing to a clear, quantifiable path forward.

## Section 1: Clear Instructions for Use

Follow these steps to complete your Decision-Making Matrix:

1.  **Define the Decision:** Clearly state the problem or choice you are facing.
    *   *Fill-in Field:* Decision Statement: [                                                               ]
2.  **Identify Options:** List the 2-4 primary options you are considering.
    *   *Fill-in Field:* Option A: [                                 ]
    *   *Fill-in Field:* Option B: [                                 ]
    *   *Fill-in Field:* Option C: [                                 ]
3.  **Establish Criteria:** Determine the key factors (criteria) that will influence your decision (e.g., Cost, Time, Impact, Risk, Alignment with Values).
4.  **Assign Weights (1-10):** Assign a weight to each criterion, where 10 is critically important and 1 is least important. This reflects the relative value of each factor.
5.  **Score Options (1-10):** Score each option against each criterion, where 10 is excellent and 1 is poor. This must be an objective assessment.
6.  **Calculate Weighted Score:** Multiply the **Weight** by the **Score** for each cell.
7.  **Determine Total Score:** Sum the weighted scores for each option to find the highest-scoring choice.

## Section 2: The Decision-Making Matrix (Template)

Use the table below to structure your analysis.

| Criteria | Weight (1-10) | Option A: [A] Score (1-10) | Option A Weighted Score | Option B: [B] Score (1-10) | Option B Weighted Score | Option C: [C] Score (1-10) | Option C Weighted Score |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Criterion 1:** | | | | | | | |
| **Criterion 2:** | | | | | | | |
| **Criterion 3:** | | | | | | | |
| **Criterion 4:** | | | | | | | |
| **Criterion 5:** | | | | | | | |
| **Criterion 6:** | | | | | | | |
| **TOTAL SCORE:** | **N/A** | **N/A** | **[  ]** | **N/A** | **[  ]** | **N/A** | **[  ]** |

**Final Result:** The highest-scoring option is: [                                 ]

## Section 3: Reflection and Analysis

Before committing to the result, use these questions to reflect on the process and validate your choice.

1.  **Alignment Check:** Did the final score align with your initial gut feeling? Why or why not?
    *   *Fill-in Field:* [                                                               ]
2.  **Bias Review:** Which criteria did you assign the highest weights to? Do these weights reflect your true, long-term values, or a short-term bias (e.g., prioritizing cost over long-term impact)?
    *   *Fill-in Field:* [                                                               ]
3.  **Sensitivity Analysis:** If you were to change the weight of your top two criteria by 2 points, would the final result change? What does this tell you about the robustness of your decision?
    *   *Fill-in Field:* [                                                               ]

## Section 4: Action Steps and Tracking

A decision is only as good as its execution. Commit to the chosen option and define the immediate steps for implementation.

### Action Steps

*   [ ] **Commitment:** I formally commit to executing the highest-scoring option.
*   [ ] **First Step:** Define the single, most immediate action required.
    *   *Fill-in Field:* [                                                               ]
*   [ ] **Second Step:** Define the next logical step.
    *   *Fill-in Field:* [                                                               ]
*   [ ] **Third Step:** Define the third step to build momentum.
    *   *Fill-in Field:* [                                                               ]

### Implementation Tracking Table

Use this table to track the progress of your chosen option's implementation.

| Task/Milestone | Deadline | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task 1:** | | [ ] To Do / [ ] Done | |
| **Task 2:** | | [ ] To Do / [ ] Done | |
| **Task 3:** | | [ ] To Do / [ ] Done | |
| **Task 4:** | | [ ] To Do / [ ] Done | |
