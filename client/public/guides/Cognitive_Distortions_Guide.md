### Common Cognitive Distortions

**1. All-or-Nothing Thinking (or Black-and-White Thinking)**

*   **Description:** Seeing things in absolute, black-and-white categories. If a situation falls short of perfect, you see it as a total failure.
*   **Example:** "I got a B on the test. I'm a complete failure."
*   **Challenge:** Are there any shades of gray? Is it really all or nothing?

**2. Overgeneralization**

*   **Description:** Viewing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.
*   **Example:** "I didn't get the job. I'll never get a job."
*   **Challenge:** Is there any evidence to suggest that this is not a never-ending pattern?

**3. Mental Filter**

*   **Description:** Picking out a single negative detail and dwelling on it exclusively, so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened.
*   **Example:** You receive many positive comments on a presentation, but you focus on the one negative comment.
*   **Challenge:** What are the positives in this situation that I am ignoring?

**4. Disqualifying the Positive**

*   **Description:** Rejecting positive experiences by insisting they "don't count."
*   **Example:** "I only did well on the test because it was easy."
*   **Challenge:** What if this positive experience does count? What would that mean?

**5. Jumping to Conclusions**

*   **Description:** Making a negative interpretation without any definite facts to support your conclusion.
    *   **Mind Reading:** Arbitrarily concluding that someone is reacting negatively to you without checking it out.
    *   **Fortune Telling:** Anticipating that things will turn out badly and being convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact.
*   **Example:** "He didn't say hi to me. He must be mad at me." (Mind Reading) "I'm going to fail the exam." (Fortune Telling)
*   **Challenge:** What evidence do I have to support my conclusion? What are some alternative explanations?

**6. Magnification (Catastrophizing) and Minimization**

*   **Description:** Exaggerating the importance of your problems and shortcomings, or minimizing the importance of your desirable qualities.
*   **Example:** "I made a mistake. It's the end of the world." (Magnification) "I got a promotion, but it's not a big deal." (Minimization)
*   **Challenge:** What is a more realistic way of looking at this situation?

**7. Emotional Reasoning**

*   **Description:** Assuming that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are.
*   **Example:** "I feel like a failure, so I must be a failure."
*   **Challenge:** What if my feelings are not facts? What evidence do I have to support my feeling?

**8. "Should" Statements**

*   **Description:** Trying to motivate yourself with "shoulds" and "shouldn'ts," as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything.
*   **Example:** "I should be more productive."
*   **Challenge:** What would happen if I didn't do what I think I "should" do? What is a more compassionate and motivating way of talking to myself?

**9. Labeling and Mislabeling**

*   **Description:** An extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself.
*   **Example:** "I'm a loser."
*   **Challenge:** Can I describe my behavior without labeling myself?

**10. Personalization**

*   **Description:** Seeing yourself as the cause of some negative external event that you were not primarily responsible for.
*   **Example:** "It's my fault that the party was boring."
*   **Challenge:** What other factors could have contributed to this situation?
