# Cardio Program Template: Optimize Your Cardiovascular Health

**Material Name:** Cardio Program Template
**Category:** Template
**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Purpose and Instructions

### 1.1. Purpose
This **Cardio Program Template** is a structured, evidence-based tool designed to help coaching clients plan, execute, and track their cardiovascular exercise regimen. Regular cardio is essential for heart health, weight management, and improved endurance. This template ensures your program is balanced, progressive, and aligned with your fitness goals.

### 1.2. Instructions for Use
1.  **Program Design (Section 2):** Complete the initial design table with your target frequency, type of exercise, duration, and target heart rate zones (Intensity). Use the **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)** scale as a simple, effective measure of intensity.
2.  **Weekly Tracking (Section 3):** Log each cardio session immediately after completion. Be honest about your actual performance and how you felt.
3.  **Reflection (Section 4):** At the end of each week or program cycle, use the reflection questions to assess your progress and adjust your plan for the next cycle.
4.  **Action Steps (Section 5):** Translate your reflections into concrete, measurable action steps to ensure continuous improvement.

## 2. Program Design: Setting Your Goals

Use this table to define the parameters of your cardio program.

| Parameter | Goal/Target Setting | Evidence-Based Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | **[Fill-in: e.g., 3-5 sessions per week]** | Consistent frequency is key to improving cardiorespiratory fitness [1]. |
| **Type** | **[Fill-in: e.g., Running, Cycling, Swimming, HIIT]** | Choose activities you enjoy to ensure adherence. Varying types can prevent overuse injuries [2]. |
| **Duration** | **[Fill-in: e.g., 30-60 minutes per session]** | Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week [3]. |
| **Intensity (RPE)** | **[Fill-in: e.g., RPE 4-6 (Moderate) or 7-8 (Vigorous)]** | RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) is a subjective measure of intensity (Scale 1-10). Moderate is a level where you can talk but not sing. |
| **Target Heart Rate Zone** | **[Fill-in: e.g., 60-80% of Max HR]** | For a more precise measure, calculate your target heart rate zone (220 - Age = Max HR). |

## 4. Progress and Reflection

Answer these questions at the end of your program cycle (e.g., weekly or monthly) to evaluate your progress.

### Reflection Questions
1.  **Adherence:** How many of your planned sessions did you complete? What was the primary barrier to completing the others?
    *   **[Fill-in: Your Answer]**
2.  **Intensity:** Did you consistently meet your target RPE/Heart Rate zone? If not, was the session too easy or too hard?
    *   **[Fill-in: Your Answer]**
3.  **Subjective Feeling:** How has your energy level and overall mood changed since starting this program?
    *   **[Fill-in: Your Answer]**
4.  **Endurance:** Do you notice any improvement in your ability to sustain a given pace or intensity? (e.g., "I can now run for 5 minutes longer at the same pace.")
    *   **[Fill-in: Your Answer]**

## 5. Action Steps: Planning for the Next Cycle

Based on your reflection, define three concrete action steps for the next cycle.

| # | Action Step (SMART Goal) | Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **[Fill-in: e.g., Increase all session durations by 5 minutes.]** | [ ] |
| 2 | **[Fill-in: e.g., Incorporate one HIIT session to increase vigorous-intensity work.]** | [ ] |
| 3 | **[Fill-in: e.g., Schedule my Monday session on Sunday night to ensure I don't miss it.]** | [ ] |
