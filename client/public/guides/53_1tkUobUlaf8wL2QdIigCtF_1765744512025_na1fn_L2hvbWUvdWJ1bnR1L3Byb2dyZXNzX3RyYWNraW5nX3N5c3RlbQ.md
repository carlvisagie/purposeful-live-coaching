## I. Purpose and Instructions

### Purpose
This **Progress Tracking System** is a structured worksheet designed to help you systematically monitor your progress, maintain accountability, and make data-driven adjustments to your action plan. Consistent tracking is an evidence-based practice that significantly increases the likelihood of achieving long-term goals [1].

### Instructions for Use
1.  **Define Your Goal:** Clearly articulate your primary goal and the specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you will use to measure success.
2.  **Initial Assessment:** Complete the "Starting Point" section to establish a baseline.
3.  **Weekly/Monthly Tracking:** Use the **Progress Log Table** to record your actions, the outcome, and your current status. Be honest and objective.
4.  **Reflect and Adjust:** Use the **Reflection Questions** section to analyze your data and identify what is working and what needs to change.
5.  **Plan Next Steps:** Based on your reflection, define clear, actionable steps for the next tracking period.

## II. Goal Definition and Baseline

**Primary Goal:** [Fill in your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound goal here]

**Target Completion Date:** [MM/DD/YYYY]

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
1.  KPI 1 (e.g., Revenue, Weight, Time Spent): [Define KPI]
2.  KPI 2 (e.g., Client Satisfaction Score, Pages Written): [Define KPI]

**Starting Point (Baseline Data):**
| KPI | Initial Value | Date Measured |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [KPI 1 Name] | [Value] | [Date] |
| [KPI 2 Name] | [Value] | [Date] |

## III. Progress Log Table (Tracking Template)

Use this table to log your actions and measure their impact.

| Date | Action Taken (Specific & Measurable) | KPI 1 Status | KPI 2 Status | Outcome/Result | Status (Complete/In Progress/Blocked) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [MM/DD] | [Action 1] | [Value] | [Value] | [Brief summary of result] | [ ] Complete / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Blocked |
| [MM/DD] | [Action 2] | [Value] | [Value] | [Brief summary of result] | [ ] Complete / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Blocked |
| [MM/DD] | [Action 3] | [Value] | [Value] | [Brief summary of result] | [ ] Complete / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Blocked |
| [MM/DD] | [Action 4] | [Value] | [Value] | [Brief summary of result] | [ ] Complete / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Blocked |
| [MM/DD] | [Action 5] | [Value] | [Value] | [Brief summary of result] | [ ] Complete / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Blocked |

## IV. Reflection and Analysis

Use these questions to guide your review of the tracking period.

1.  **What was the single most effective action I took this period?**
    [Write your reflection here]
2.  **Where did I encounter the most resistance or unexpected obstacles?**
    [Write your reflection here]
3.  **Based on the data in the Progress Log, is my current strategy working?**
    [ ] Yes, continue. / [ ] No, major adjustment needed.
4.  **What is the key lesson I learned from this tracking period?**
    [Write your reflection here]

## V. Action Steps and Commitment

Based on your reflection, define your next steps and commit to them.

**Next 3 Action Steps (SMART format):**
*   [ ] **Action 1:** [Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound action]
*   [ ] **Action 2:** [Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound action]
*   [ ] **Action 3:** [Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound action]

**Commitment Statement:**
