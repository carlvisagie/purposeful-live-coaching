## 1. Purpose and Instructions

### Purpose
This worksheet is designed to help you transition from a reactive "to-do list" approach to a proactive, focused **Time Blocking** system. Time blocking is a time management method where you schedule specific blocks of time for specific tasks or task groups, treating your calendar as a finite resource, similar to a budget. This technique is proven to enhance focus, reduce procrastination, and provide a realistic view of what can be accomplished in a day [1].

### Instructions for Use
1.  **Review Your Week:** Before starting, review your existing commitments (meetings, appointments) and estimate the time required for your top priorities.
2.  **Block the Essentials:** Schedule blocks for non-negotiable activities like sleep, meals, and exercise first.
3.  **Assign Tasks to Blocks:** Assign specific tasks to the remaining time blocks. Be realistic and include buffer time.
4.  **Defend Your Blocks:** Once a block is set, treat it as a meeting you cannot miss. Close distractions and focus only on the assigned task.
5.  **Reflect and Adjust:** At the end of the day or week, use the reflection section to evaluate your adherence and adjust your schedule for the next period.
