### What is Earthing?

Earthing (or grounding) is the practice of connecting with the Earth's natural electrical charge. This can be done by walking barefoot on the ground, sitting or lying on the ground, or using a grounding mat or other grounding device.

### Potential Health Benefits

Research on the health benefits of earthing is still in its early stages, but some studies suggest that it may help to:

*   Reduce inflammation
*   Improve sleep
*   Reduce pain
*   Reduce stress
*   Improve circulation
*   Increase energy

### How to Practice Earthing

*   **Go barefoot:** The easiest way to practice earthing is to simply go barefoot on the ground. You can do this in your backyard, at a park, or at the beach.
*   **Sit or lie on the ground:** You can also practice earthing by sitting or lying on the ground. You can do this on the grass, on the sand, or on a rock.
*   **Use a grounding mat:** If you are not able to go barefoot or sit on the ground, you can use a grounding mat. A grounding mat is a conductive mat that you can place on your floor or on your bed. You can then connect the mat to the ground port of an electrical outlet.

### How Long to Practice Earthing

There is no set amount of time that you need to practice earthing. Some people find that they feel the benefits after just a few minutes, while others find that they need to practice for longer periods of time. Experiment to see what works best for you.
