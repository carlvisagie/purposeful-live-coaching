# Breathing Pattern Tracker: A Tool for Nervous System Regulation

## Purpose and Evidence-Based Rationale

The way we breathe is intrinsically linked to our **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**, which controls our body's involuntary functions, including the "fight or flight" (sympathetic) and "rest and digest" (parasympathetic) responses. A rapid, shallow, or chest-dominant breathing pattern is a physiological marker of stress and sympathetic activation. Conversely, slow, deep, and diaphragmatic breathing signals safety and promotes parasympathetic dominance, leading to reduced anxiety, improved focus, and better emotional regulation [1].

This tracker is an evidence-based tool designed to help you become consciously aware of your habitual breathing patterns. By tracking and analyzing your patterns in different contexts, you can identify triggers for dysfunctional breathing and actively practice techniques to shift towards a more regulated, optimal state.

## Instructions for Use

Use this tracker a minimum of **three times per day**—morning, midday, and evening—or whenever you notice a significant change in your emotional state or stress level.

1.  **Observe:** Take a moment to simply observe your natural breathing without trying to change it. Place one hand on your chest and one on your abdomen.
2.  **Record:** Note the time, context, and your observations in the table below.
3.  **Analyze:** At the end of the week, review your entries using the Reflection Questions to identify patterns and inform your action steps.

## Reflection and Analysis

Use these questions to process the data you have collected.

1.  **Pattern Identification:** In which contexts (e.g., work, social, before meals) did I most frequently observe a shallow, fast, or chest-dominant breathing pattern?

2.  **Correlation:** What is the relationship between my observed breathing pattern and my reported Stress Level (1-10)? Did a specific pattern always accompany a high stress score?

3.  **Insight:** What is the single most important insight I gained this week about my body's response to stress?

## Action Steps and Integration

Based on your reflection, commit to the following steps to integrate healthier breathing habits.

*   **Practice Goal:** I will practice diaphragmatic breathing for **[Fill in number]** minutes, **[Fill in number]** times per day.
*   **Trigger Strategy:** I will use the following trigger to remind myself to check my breathing pattern: **[Fill in specific trigger, e.g., "Every time I open my laptop" or "Before every meeting"]**.
*   **Commitment:** I commit to immediately shifting to a slow, deep, diaphragmatic breath whenever I notice my breathing is shallow or fast. [ ] (Check box to commit)
