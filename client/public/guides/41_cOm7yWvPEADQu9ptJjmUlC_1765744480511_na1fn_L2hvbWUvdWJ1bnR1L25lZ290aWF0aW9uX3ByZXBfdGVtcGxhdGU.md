**Category:** Template

## 1. Purpose and Instructions

This template is designed to guide you through a structured, evidence-based preparation process for any negotiation, from salary discussions to complex business deals. Effective preparation is the single most critical factor in achieving superior negotiation outcomes [1]. By systematically analyzing your position, understanding the other party, and planning your strategy, you can move from an emotional reaction to a strategic, confident approach.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Complete all sections** before entering the negotiation. Do not skip the "Understanding the Other Party" section, as empathy is a powerful tool.
2.  **Be specific.** Use concrete numbers, clear interests, and measurable outcomes.
3.  **Review and reflect** using Section 5 to ensure you are mentally and strategically ready.

## 2. Defining Your Position: Goals and Alternatives (BATNA)

The foundation of your power in any negotiation is your **BATNA** (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). Knowing your BATNA prevents you from accepting a deal that is worse than walking away.

| Concept | Definition | Your Target | Your Reservation Point (Walk-Away) | Your BATNA (Alternative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Point** | Your ideal, ambitious, yet realistic outcome. | [Fill in: e.g., $120,000 salary] | [Fill in: e.g., $105,000 salary] | [Fill in: e.g., Job offer at Company B for $108,000] |
| **Reservation Point** | The absolute minimum acceptable outcome. Below this, you walk away. | | | |
| **BATNA** | Your best course of action if the negotiation fails. This is your leverage. | | | |

**Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** The overlap between your Reservation Point and the other party's Reservation Point. Your goal is to estimate their Reservation Point and aim for a deal within the ZOPA.

**Opening Offer/Demand:**
*   What is your planned opening offer? (It should be higher/lower than your Target Point to allow for movement).
*   [Fill in: My opening offer/demand will be...]

## 3. Understanding the Other Party: Interests and Needs

A successful negotiation is not about winning, but about satisfying underlying interests. Focus on *why* the other party wants what they want, not just *what* they want [2].

| Analysis Area | Other Party's Likely Position/Demand | Their Underlying Interests (Why?) | Their Potential BATNA (Their Leverage) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Issue** | [Fill in: e.g., Lower price] | [Fill in: e.g., Need to meet quarterly budget] | [Fill in: e.g., Competitor X's bid] |
| **Secondary Issue 1** | [Fill in:] | [Fill in:] | [Fill in:] |
| **Secondary Issue 2** | [Fill in:] | [Fill in:] | [Fill in:] |

**Key Assumptions to Test:**
*   What assumptions am I making about the other party's motivations or constraints?
    *   [ ] Assumption 1: [Fill in:]
    *   [ ] Assumption 2: [Fill in:]

## 4. Strategy and Concession Planning

Plan your moves and counter-moves. Never make a concession without getting something in return.

### 4.1. Concession Planning Table

List potential concessions you are willing to make, ranked by their cost to you (Low, Medium, High).

| Concession Item | Cost to Me (Low/Med/High) | Value to Them (Estimate) | When to Offer (Trigger) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Fill in: e.g., Extended payment terms] | [Fill in: Low] | [Fill in: High] | [Fill in: If they counter my second offer] |
| [Fill in: e.g., Reduced scope] | [Fill in:] | [Fill in:] | [Fill in:] |
| [Fill in: e.g., Free training session] | [Fill in:] | [Fill in:] | [Fill in:] |

### 4.2. Counter-Argument Preparation

Anticipate their three most likely objections and prepare a clear, interest-based response for each.

1.  **Objection:** [Fill in:]
    **My Response:** [Fill in:]
2.  **Objection:** [Fill in:]
    **My Response:** [Fill in:]
3.  **Objection:** [Fill in:]
    **My Response:** [Fill in:]

## 5. Reflection and Final Action Steps

Use these questions to ensure you are fully prepared and in the right mindset.

### 5.1. Reflection Questions

*   Have I clearly defined my BATNA and am I truly willing to walk away if my Reservation Point is not met?
    *   [Fill in: Yes/No, and why]
*   What is the single most important interest for the other party, and how can I help them satisfy it while meeting my own goals?
    *   [Fill in: My answer]
*   What non-monetary issues (e.g., relationship, reputation, timing) might influence the outcome, and how will I address them?
    *   [Fill in: My answer]

### 5.2. Final Action Checklist

*   [ ] Review all sections and ensure all fields are complete.
*   [ ] Practice my opening statement and my response to the most likely objection.
*   [ ] Confirm the time, location, and attendees for the negotiation.
*   [ ] Gather all necessary supporting documents (e.g., market data, previous agreements).
*   [ ] Decide on a time limit for the negotiation before taking a break or concluding.
