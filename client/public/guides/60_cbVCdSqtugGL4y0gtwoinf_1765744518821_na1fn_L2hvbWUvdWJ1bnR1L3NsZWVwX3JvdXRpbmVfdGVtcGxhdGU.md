# Sleep Routine Template: Architecting Your Rest

## 1. Purpose and Instructions

### Purpose
This **Sleep Routine Template** is designed to help you establish a consistent, personalized, and evidence-based routine to optimize your sleep quality and overall well-being. Consistent sleep hygiene is a cornerstone of mental clarity, emotional regulation, and physical health. By standardizing your pre-sleep and morning activities, you signal to your body that it's time to rest and reinforce your natural circadian rhythm.

### How to Use This Template
1.  **Personalize:** In the tables below, customize the "Activity" column to fit your preferences (e.g., "Read a book" instead of "Light reading").
2.  **Schedule:** Fill in the "Target Time" column for each activity. Aim for a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends.
3.  **Track:** Use the "Completed" checkbox daily to track adherence.
4.  **Reflect:** Use the "Weekly Reflection" section to analyze your progress and make necessary adjustments.

## 2. The Evening Wind-Down Routine

A successful sleep routine begins **60-90 minutes** before your target bedtime. This period is crucial for lowering your core body temperature and reducing mental stimulation.

| Time Before Bed | Target Time | Activity | Rationale (Evidence-Based) | Completed (☐) |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **90-60 min** | [Fill in Time] | **Light Exercise/Stretching:** Gentle yoga or light stretching. Avoid intense cardio. | Promotes muscle relaxation without raising core temperature too close to sleep [1]. | ☐ |
| **60-45 min** | [Fill in Time] | **Stop Eating/Drinking:** Finish all meals and limit fluid intake. | Prevents digestive discomfort and reduces the likelihood of nighttime awakenings for bathroom breaks [2]. | ☐ |
| **45-30 min** | [Fill in Time] | **Dim the Lights:** Switch to low-wattage lamps or use blue-light-blocking glasses. | Signals the brain to increase melatonin production, the hormone that regulates sleep [3]. | ☐ |
| **30-15 min** | [Fill in Time] | **Prepare Environment:** Set bedroom temperature to a cool 60-67°F (15-19°C). | A cooler environment facilitates the drop in core body temperature necessary for sleep onset [4]. | ☐ |
| **15-0 min** | [Fill in Time] | **Mindful Activity:** Light reading (physical book), deep breathing, or journaling. | Calms the nervous system and shifts focus away from daily stressors [5]. | ☐ |
| **Target Bedtime** | [Fill in Time] | **Lights Out.** | Consistency is key for regulating the circadian rhythm. | ☐ |

## 3. The Morning Anchor Routine

Your morning routine helps solidify your circadian rhythm by providing a clear signal that the rest period is over.

| Time After Wake-Up | Target Time | Activity | Rationale (Evidence-Based) | Completed (☐) |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **0-5 min** | [Fill in Time] | **Immediate Light Exposure:** Open curtains or step outside for 5-10 minutes. | Suppresses melatonin production and resets the circadian clock for the day [6]. | ☐ |
| **5-15 min** | [Fill in Time] | **Hydration:** Drink a full glass of water. | Rehydrates the body after a night of rest. | ☐ |
| **15-30 min** | [Fill in Time] | **Movement:** Gentle stretching or a short walk. | Increases blood flow and energy levels. | ☐ |
| **Target Wake-Up** | [Fill in Time] | **Start the Day.** | Maintain consistency to stabilize your sleep-wake cycle. | ☐ |
