## 1. Purpose and Instructions

### Purpose
This **Resilience Assessment** is an evidence-based tool designed to help you evaluate your current capacity to cope with stress, adapt to adversity, and recover from setbacks. Resilience is not an innate trait but a set of skills that can be developed. By completing this assessment, you will gain clarity on your strengths and identify specific areas for growth in your resilience journey.

### Instructions
1.  Read each statement carefully.
2.  In the "Your Score" column, rate how true the statement is for you **right now**, using the following 5-point scale:
    *   **1 - Rarely/Never True**
    *   **2 - Sometimes True**
    *   **3 - Moderately True**
    *   **4 - Often True**
    *   **5 - Almost Always True**
3.  Be honest with your responses. There are no right or wrong answers.
