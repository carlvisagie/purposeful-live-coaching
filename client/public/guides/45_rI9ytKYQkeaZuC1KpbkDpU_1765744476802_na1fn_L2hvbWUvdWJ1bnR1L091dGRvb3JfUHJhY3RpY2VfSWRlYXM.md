## Structured Outdoor Practice Ideas

The following table outlines three core practices, their primary focus, and suggested duration.

| Practice Idea | Primary Focus | Suggested Duration | Key Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mindful Nature Walk** | Sensory awareness, presence, stress reduction | 15-30 minutes | Walk slowly, noticing 5 things you see, 4 things you hear, 3 things you feel, 2 things you smell, and 1 thing you taste. |
| **The "Sit Spot"** | Deep observation, stillness, reflection | 20-45 minutes | Find a comfortable spot outdoors. Sit quietly and observe the environment without judgment. Use this time for journaling. |
