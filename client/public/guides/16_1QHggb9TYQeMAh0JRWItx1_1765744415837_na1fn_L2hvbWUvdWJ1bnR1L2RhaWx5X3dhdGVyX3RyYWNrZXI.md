# Daily Water Tracker: Hydration for Optimal Performance

## Purpose and Rationale

This **Daily Water Tracker** is designed to help you monitor and optimize your fluid intake, a critical component of overall health and peak performance. Adequate hydration is essential for regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, delivering nutrients to cells, and maintaining cognitive function [1]. By consistently tracking your water consumption, you can identify patterns, ensure you meet your daily goals, and directly experience the benefits of optimal hydration.

## The Science of Hydration

The human body is approximately 60% water, and even mild dehydration can negatively impact mood, concentration, and physical endurance [2]. While individual needs vary based on activity level, climate, and health status, a general guideline for daily fluid intake is often cited as 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) for men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) for women, which includes fluids from food and beverages [3].

**Your Personalized Hydration Goal:**
