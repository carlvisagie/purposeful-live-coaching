# Optimism Builder: A Cognitive Restructuring Worksheet

**Category:** Worksheet
**Material Name:** Optimism Builder

## Purpose and Introduction

This worksheet is designed to help you cultivate a more optimistic explanatory style, a key component of resilience and well-being, based on the principles of **Learned Optimism** [1]. Your explanatory style is the way you typically explain why good and bad events happen to you. By consciously shifting from a pessimistic to an optimistic style, you can significantly improve your motivation, performance, and emotional health.

## Clear Instructions: How to Use This Worksheet

1.  **Commitment:** Dedicate 15-20 minutes to this exercise, ideally when you are calm and focused.
2.  **Identify:** In Section 1, recall a recent challenging event and analyze your initial explanation for it.
3.  **Challenge:** Use the ABCDE model in Section 2 to actively dispute and reframe your initial pessimistic thoughts.
4.  **Track:** Use the tracking table in Section 3 to monitor your progress over the next week.
5.  **Reflect:** Complete the final reflection questions to solidify your learning.

## Section 1: Analyzing Your Explanatory Style

A pessimistic explanatory style views bad events as **Permanent**, **Pervasive**, and **Personal**. An optimistic style views them as **Temporary**, **Specific**, and **External**.

| Explanatory Dimension | Pessimistic Style (Initial Thought) | Optimistic Style (Reframed Thought) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Permanence** (Will this last forever?) | "This always happens to me." | "This is a temporary setback." |
| **Pervasiveness** (Will this affect everything?) | "I fail at everything I try." | "This is specific to this one area." |
| **Personalization** (Is this all my fault?) | "I am incompetent." | "External factors contributed to this." |

**Your Recent Challenging Event:**
Describe a recent setback or challenge (e.g., a missed deadline, a disagreement, a failed attempt):
________________________________________________________________________________

**Your Initial Explanation (Pessimistic Check):**
*   **Permanent:** [ ] Yes / [ ] No. Why? _______________________________________
*   **Pervasive:** [ ] Yes / [ ] No. Why? _________________________________________
*   **Personal:** [ ] Yes / [ ] No. Why? ___________________________________________

## Section 2: The ABCDE Model for Disputation

Use the five steps below to challenge and change your pessimistic thoughts.

| Step | Description | Your Entry |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | **Adversity:** The event that happened. | ________________________________________________________________ |
| **B** | **Belief:** Your immediate, pessimistic interpretation of the event. | ________________________________________________________________ |
| **C** | **Consequence:** The feeling and action that resulted from your belief. | ________________________________________________________________ |
| **D** | **Disputation:** Challenge your belief with evidence, alternatives, and utility. | **Evidence:** What facts contradict my belief? ________________________________________________________________<br>**Alternatives:** What are other possible explanations? ________________________________________________________________<br>**Utility:** Is this belief helpful? [ ] Yes / [ ] No. |
| **E** | **Energization:** The positive feeling and action that results from successful disputation. | I feel: ________________________________________________________________<br>I will do: ________________________________________________________________ |

## Section 3: Optimism Tracking Table

Track your use of the ABCDE model and the resulting shift in your explanatory style over the next week.

| Date | Event (Adversity) | Initial Pessimistic Belief (B) | Reframed Optimistic Thought (E) | Shift Rating (1=No Change, 5=Major Shift) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [ ] Day 1 | ____________________ | ____________________ | ____________________ | [ ] 1 [ ] 2 [ ] 3 [ ] 4 [ ] 5 |
| [ ] Day 2 | ____________________ | ____________________ | ____________________ | [ ] 1 [ ] 2 [ ] 3 [ ] 4 [ ] 5 |
| [ ] Day 3 | ____________________ | ____________________ | ____________________ | [ ] 1 [ ] 2 [ ] 3 [ ] 4 [ ] 5 |
| [ ] Day 4 | ____________________ | ____________________ | ____________________ | [ ] 1 [ ] 2 [ ] 3 [ ] 4 [ ] 5 |
| [ ] Day 5 | ____________________ | ____________________ | ____________________ | [ ] 1 [ ] 2 [ ] 3 [ ] 4 [ ] 5 |
