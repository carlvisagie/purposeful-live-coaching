# VIA Character Strengths: From Awareness to Action

**Material Name:** VIA Character Strengths Survey
**Category:** Worksheet
**Author:** Manus AI

## Purpose and Overview

The **VIA Character Strengths Survey** (Values in Action) is a scientifically validated tool from the field of positive psychology that identifies an individual's most core positive personality traits, known as **Signature Strengths** [1]. These strengths are the capacities for thinking, feeling, and behaving that come naturally to you and are energizing to use.

The purpose of this worksheet is to guide you, the coaching client, in moving **beyond awareness** of your strengths to **active application** in your daily life and toward your personal and professional goals. Research consistently shows that intentionally using your signature strengths leads to increased happiness, engagement, and meaning [2].

## Instructions for Use

1.  **Complete the Survey:** Ensure you have taken the official VIA Character Strengths Survey and have your personalized results.
2.  **Identify Your Top Strengths:** Record your top 5 Signature Strengths in the table below.
3.  **Reflect Deeply:** Dedicate focused time to answer the reflection questions in Section 2. Be honest and detailed in your responses.
4.  **Commit to Action:** Use the "Strengths in Action" table to plan specific, measurable ways to use your strengths this week.
