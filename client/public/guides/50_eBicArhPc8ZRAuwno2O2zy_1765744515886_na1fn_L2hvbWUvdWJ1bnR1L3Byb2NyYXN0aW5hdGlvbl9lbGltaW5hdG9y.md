# Procrastination Eliminator: A Worksheet for Emotional Regulation

**Material Name:** Procrastination Eliminator
**Category:** Worksheet
**Purpose:** To help coaching clients overcome procrastination by reframing it as an emotional regulation challenge and applying evidence-based strategies to initiate action.

## Introduction: The Emotional Root of Procrastination

For too long, procrastination has been mistakenly viewed as a failure of time management or a sign of laziness. However, contemporary psychological research indicates that **procrastination is fundamentally an emotion regulation problem** [1].

We delay tasks not because we are bad at managing our time, but because we are trying to manage a negative mood or emotion associated with the task—such as anxiety, fear of failure, boredom, self-doubt, or frustration. The immediate relief from avoiding the task is a temporary emotional fix, which ultimately creates more stress later.

The purpose of this worksheet is to help you identify the specific negative emotion driving your avoidance and use a simple, powerful technique to shift your emotional state, making action possible.

## Section 2: The Procrastination Eliminator Technique

This technique is based on the principle that **action precedes motivation**. The goal is not to finish the task, but to change your emotional state by committing to a small, non-threatening action.

### The 5-Minute Rule

1.  **Name the Emotion:** Acknowledge the emotion you identified in Section 1. Say it out loud: "I feel [Emotion] about this task." This validates the feeling without letting it control your behavior.
2.  **Commit to 5 Minutes:** Set a timer for exactly **five minutes**. Commit to working on the task for only this short, non-negotiable period. You have full permission to stop when the timer goes off.
3.  **Start the Smallest Step:** Identify the absolute smallest step you can take. (e.g., "Open the document," "Write the first sentence," "Find the relevant file.")
4.  **Track the Shift:** Use the table below to track your emotional state before and after the 5-minute commitment.

**Emotional Shift Tracking Table (Tracking Table):**

| Task Description | Emotion Before (Scale 1-10) | 5-Minute Action Taken | Emotion After (Scale 1-10) | Did I Continue? (Check) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
