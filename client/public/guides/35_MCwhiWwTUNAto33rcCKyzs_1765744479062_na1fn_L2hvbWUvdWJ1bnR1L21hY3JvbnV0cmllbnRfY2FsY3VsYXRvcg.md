# Macronutrient Calculator: Your Personalized Fuel Plan

This material is designed to provide a structured, evidence-based method for calculating your daily caloric needs and determining the optimal macronutrient breakdown (Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats) to support your specific health and fitness goals. This is a foundational tool for personalized nutrition coaching.

## 1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculation

Your **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic, life-sustaining functions while at rest. We will use the **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation**, which is widely considered one of the most accurate predictive formulas [1].

### Step 1.1: Input Your Data

Please fill in your current metrics in the table below.

| Metric | Value | Unit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sex** | [ ] Male / [ ] Female | |
| **Age** | [ ] | Years |
| **Height** | [ ] | cm |
| **Weight** | [ ] | kg |

### Step 1.2: BMR Formula

The formula is applied based on your sex:

*   **Men:** BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5
*   **Women:** BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) - 161

**Your Calculated BMR:** [ ] kcal/day

## 2. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) Calculation

Your **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)** is the total number of calories you burn in a day, including your BMR and all physical activity. To calculate this, multiply your BMR by an activity factor.

### Step 2.1: Select Your Activity Level

Check the box that best describes your weekly activity level.

| Activity Level | Multiplier | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [ ] **Sedentary** | 1.2 | Little to no exercise, desk job. |
| [ ] **Lightly Active** | 1.375 | Light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week. |
| [ ] **Moderately Active** | 1.55 | Moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week. |
| [ ] **Very Active** | 1.725 | Hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/week. |
| [ ] **Extremely Active** | 1.9 | Hard daily exercise/sports, physical job, or two-a-day training. |

### Step 2.2: TDEE Calculation

**TDEE = BMR x Activity Multiplier**

**Your Calculated TDEE:** [ ] kcal/day

## 3. Goal-Based Calorie Adjustment and Macronutrient Ratios

Your final calorie target is your TDEE adjusted for your goal. The macronutrient ratio determines the percentage of those calories that come from Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fat [2].

### Step 3.1: Adjust for Goal

Check your goal and adjust your TDEE:

| Goal | Calorie Adjustment | Target Calories |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [ ] **Weight Loss** | Subtract 300-500 kcal from TDEE | [ ] kcal/day |
| [ ] **Maintenance** | Use TDEE (no adjustment) | [ ] kcal/day |
| [ ] **Muscle Gain** | Add 250-500 kcal to TDEE | [ ] kcal/day |

### Step 3.2: Select Your Macronutrient Ratio

Check the ratio that aligns with your goal and dietary preference.

| Goal | Protein (%) | Carbohydrates (%) | Fat (%) | [ ] Select |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Health/Balance** | 20% | 50% | 30% | [ ] |
| **Weight Loss/Higher Protein** | 35% | 40% | 25% | [ ] |
| **Muscle Gain/Performance** | 30% | 50% | 20% | [ ] |
| **Low Carb/Keto** | 25% | 10% | 65% | [ ] |
| **Custom Ratio** | [ ]% | [ ]% | [ ]% | [ ] |

## 4. Final Macronutrient Grams

Use the following caloric values to convert your percentages into daily grams:

*   **Protein:** 4 kcal per gram
*   **Carbohydrates:** 4 kcal per gram
*   **Fat:** 9 kcal per gram

### Step 4.1: Final Results Table

| Macronutrient | Percentage | Calories (Target x %) | Grams (Calories / Value) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protein** | [ ]% | [ ] kcal | [ ] g |
| **Carbohydrates** | [ ]% | [ ] kcal | [ ] g |
| **Fat** | [ ]% | [ ] kcal | [ ] g |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | [ ] kcal | |

## Reflection and Action Steps

Use this section to plan how you will implement your new personalized fuel plan.

### Reflection Questions

1.  How does your calculated Target Calorie intake compare to your current estimated daily intake?
    > [ ]

2.  What is the biggest challenge you anticipate in hitting your daily protein goal?
    > [ ]

### Action Steps

Check off each step as you complete it to ensure a smooth transition.

*   [ ] **Log Your Macros:** Download a food tracking app (e.g., MyFitnessPal, Cronometer) and input your target grams.
*   [ ] **Meal Prep Plan:** Identify 3-5 go-to meals that easily fit your new macro targets.
*   [ ] **Hydration Goal:** Set a daily water intake goal to support your new nutrition plan.
    *   Target: [ ] Liters/day
*   [ ] **Coach Check-in:** Schedule a follow-up with your coach to review your first week of tracking.
