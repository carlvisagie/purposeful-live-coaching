# Time Audit Worksheet: Unlocking Your Most Valuable Resource

**Material Name:** Time Audit Worksheet
**Category:** Worksheet

## Purpose: The Foundation of Time Mastery

The **Time Audit Worksheet** is an evidence-based tool to gain radical clarity on how you spend your time. **Self-monitoring** is the critical first step in behavioral change [1]. By tracking your activities, you will uncover time sinks, identify high-value activities, and align your actions with your goals. This is objective data collection to inform strategic decisions.

## Instructions for a Successful Audit

Follow these steps for an accurate and actionable audit:

1.  **Duration:** Commit to tracking your time for a minimum of **three full days** (ideally one week, including a weekend).
2.  **Increment:** Use the provided table to track your activities in **30-minute blocks**.
3.  **Real-Time Tracking:** Record your activity *as it happens* or immediately after. Do not rely on memory at the end of the day.
4.  **Categorization:** Assign a category to each activity (e.g., Deep Work, Shallow Work, Admin, Personal Care, Commute, Waste/Distraction).
5.  **Energy Rating:** Rate your energy level during the activity on a scale of 1 (Exhausted) to 5 (Highly Energized). This helps identify your personal peak performance times.

## Section 2: Data Synthesis and Analysis

After completing your tracking period, tally the total time spent in each category.

| Category | Total Time (Hours) | High-Value (H) / Low-Value (L) | Can I Delegate/Eliminate? (Yes/No) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Deep Work** (Focused, high-impact tasks) | | | |
| **Shallow Work** (Routine, low-impact tasks) | | | |
| **Meetings/Communication** | | | |
| **Admin/Email/Paperwork** | | | |
| **Personal Care** (Sleep, Exercise, Meals) | | | |
| **Commute/Travel** | | | |
| **Distraction/Waste** (Unplanned social media, browsing) | | | |
| **Learning/Development** | | | |
| **TOTAL** | | | |

## Section 3: Reflection Questions

Use these questions to translate your data into insights.

1.  **The Reality Gap:** What is the single biggest surprise from your time log? How does your actual time allocation differ from what you *thought* it was?
    > **Answer:** [Fill in your reflection here]
2.  **Peak Performance:** When were your highest-energy blocks (rated 4 or 5)? What work were you doing?
    > **Answer:** [Fill in your reflection here]
3.  **Time Sinks:** Which activities were "Distraction/Waste," and how much time did they consume? What is the root cause?
    > **Answer:** [Fill in your reflection here]
4.  **Value Alignment:** Is your "High-Value" time receiving the necessary focus? What would be the impact if you doubled it?
    > **Answer:** [Fill in your reflection here]

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **1. Eliminate/Delegate** | | | |
| **2. Time Block** | | | |
