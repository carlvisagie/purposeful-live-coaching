**Category:** Worksheet/Template
**Author:** Manus AI

## Purpose and Overview

The **Nature Connection Tracker** is a professional, evidence-based tool designed to help you systematically monitor and deepen your relationship with the natural world. Research consistently demonstrates that a strong connection to nature is linked to significant improvements in mental health, cognitive function, and physical well-being [1] [2] [3].

This tracker provides a structured framework for recording your nature interactions, reflecting on their impact, and translating those insights into sustainable habits. By using this tool, you will gain clarity on which types of nature engagement are most beneficial for your unique needs, leading to reduced stress, improved mood, and enhanced focus [4] [5].

## Clear Instructions for Use

1.  **Define Your Goal:** Before starting, set a simple intention for your nature connection practice (e.g., "Reduce daily stress," "Improve focus," or "Increase feelings of calm").
2.  **Track Daily:** At the end of each day, or immediately following a nature interaction, record the details in the **Daily Connection Log** table below.
3.  **Rate Your Experience:** Use the **Impact Score** (1-5, where 5 is the highest positive impact) to quantify how the experience affected your mood, energy, and focus.
4.  **Weekly Reflection:** Use the **Weekly Reflection Questions** to synthesize your observations and identify patterns.
5.  **Action Planning:** Based on your reflections, define concrete **Action Steps** for the following week to further integrate nature into your life.
