# Savoring Worksheet: Amplifying Positive Experiences

**Material Name:** Savoring Worksheet
**Category:** Worksheet

## 1. Purpose and Evidence-Based Foundation

The practice of **savoring** is the intentional effort to prolong and deepen the enjoyment of a positive experience [1]. It involves paying focused attention to the moment, noticing the sensory details, and consciously appreciating the positive emotions that arise. Research in positive psychology demonstrates that actively savoring positive events—past, present, or future—significantly increases overall happiness, life satisfaction, and resilience against stress [2]. This worksheet is designed to guide you through the process of maximizing the joy and benefit from a positive experience.
