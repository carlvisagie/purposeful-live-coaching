# Reframing Worksheet: Shifting Perspective for Positive Action

## Purpose

This worksheet is designed to help you practice **cognitive reframing**, a core technique in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) [1]. Reframing is the process of consciously changing the way you look at a situation, a person, or a relationship, and consciously choosing a more constructive and balanced perspective. The goal is not to ignore reality, but to challenge automatic negative thoughts (ANTs) and replace them with thoughts that promote positive emotions and effective action.

## Instructions for Use

1.  **Identify:** Start by pinpointing a specific situation that caused a negative emotional reaction and the automatic negative thought that accompanied it.
2.  **Challenge:** Use the structured table to systematically examine the evidence for and against your initial thought. Identify any common cognitive distortions (e.g., catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking).
3.  **Reframe:** Construct a new, balanced, and more helpful thought. This new thought should be believable and grounded in reality.
4.  **Act:** Determine concrete steps you can take based on your new perspective.

## Step 1: Identify the Situation and Initial Thought

Use this section to capture the raw data of the experience. Be specific about the event and the exact thought that immediately followed.

| Element | Your Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Date & Time** | __________________________________________________ |
| **The Situation** | *Describe the specific event that triggered the negative feeling.* |
| | __________________________________________________ |
| | __________________________________________________ |
| **Automatic Negative Thought (ANT)** | *What was the exact thought that went through your mind?* |
| | __________________________________________________ |
| | __________________________________________________ |
| **Initial Emotion & Intensity** | *e.g., Anxiety, Anger, Sadness (Rate 0-100%)* |
| | __________________________________________________ |

---

## Step 2: Challenge the Thought

Systematically challenge your Automatic Negative Thought (ANT) by acting as a neutral investigator.

| Initial Thought: | __________________________________________________ |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Evidence Supporting the Thought** | **Evidence Against the Thought** |
| *List facts that make the thought seem true.* | *List facts that contradict or weaken the thought.* |
| 1. _________________________________________ | 1. _________________________________________ |
| 2. _________________________________________ | 2. _________________________________________ |
| 3. _________________________________________ | 3. _________________________________________ |

### Identify Cognitive Distortions

Review the list of common thinking errors [2] and check any that apply to your initial thought:

- [ ] All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black/White)
- [ ] Overgeneralization (One negative event is a never-ending pattern)
- [ ] Mental Filter (Focusing only on the negatives)
- [ ] Discounting the Positive
- [ ] Jumping to Conclusions (Mind Reading or Fortune Telling)
- [ ] Magnification or Minimization (Catastrophizing)
- [ ] Emotional Reasoning ("I feel it, therefore it must be true")
- [ ] "Should" Statements
- [ ] Labeling and Mislabeling
- [ ] Personalization (Taking blame for external events)

## Step 3: Create the Reframe

Based on the evidence and identified distortions, write a new, more balanced, and realistic thought.

**The Balanced Reframe:**

*This new thought should be a balanced summary of the evidence, acknowledging reality while offering a constructive perspective.*

________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________

**New Emotion & Intensity:**

*What is your emotional state now? (Rate 0-100%)*

## Reflection and Integration

Take a moment to reflect on the impact of this reframing exercise.

1.  How does the balanced reframe change your perception of the situation?
    ________________________________________________________________________________
2.  What is the most important lesson you learned about your thinking pattern today?
    ________________________________________________________________________________
3.  If a friend were in this exact situation, what advice would you give them?
    ________________________________________________________________________________

## Action Steps

Reframing is only the first step; action solidifies the change. Check the boxes for actions you commit to taking.

- [ ] **Commitment:** I will review this balanced reframe at least three times today.
- [ ] **Communication:** I will discuss this situation and my new perspective with my coach/accountability partner.
- [ ] **Behavioral Change:** I will take the following concrete, small action based on my new perspective:
    ________________________________________________________________________________
- [ ] **Tracking:** I will use the tracking table below to monitor my progress over the next week.

## Tracking Your Progress

Use this table to track how often you successfully apply your new reframe in similar situations.

| Date | Situation | Old Thought | New Reframe Applied? (Y/N) | Outcome/Lesson Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _________________ | _________________ | _________________ | [ ] | _________________ |
| _________________ | _________________ | _________________ | [ ] | _________________ |
| _________________ | _________________ | _________________ | [ ] | _________________ |
