# Light Exposure Tracker: Optimizing Your Circadian Rhythm

**Category: Worksheet**

## 1. Purpose and Instructions

The timing and intensity of light exposure are the single most powerful regulators of your **circadian rhythm**—your body's internal 24-hour clock. By tracking your light habits, you can identify patterns that may be disrupting your sleep, energy, and mood, and take evidence-based steps to optimize your health.

### How to Use This Tracker

1.  **Complete Daily:** Fill out a row in the tracking table (Section 3) each evening or the following morning.
2.  **Be Specific:** Note the *time* and *duration* of your key light exposures.
3.  **Reflect:** Use the Reflection Questions (Section 4) at the end of the week to analyze your data and plan your next steps.

## 2. The Science of Light and Your Body

Light does more than help you see; it sends critical signals to your brain's master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

*   **Morning Light (The Wake-Up Signal):** Exposure to bright, natural light (especially blue-rich sunlight) early in the day signals to your SCN that the day has begun. This suppresses the sleep hormone **melatonin** and sets the clock for a timely release of melatonin later that night, promoting deep, restorative sleep [1] [2].
    *   **Recommendation:** Aim for **10-30 minutes** of outdoor light within the first hour of waking [3].
*   **Evening Light (The Sleep Signal):** Exposure to artificial light, particularly blue light from screens (phones, laptops, TVs), in the hours before bed can significantly delay the natural release of melatonin, shifting your entire circadian rhythm later and leading to difficulty falling asleep and poor sleep quality [4] [5].
    *   **Recommendation:** Minimize blue light exposure for **2-3 hours** before your desired bedtime.

## 3. Daily Light Exposure Tracking Table

Use this table to track your light habits over a week.

| Date | Time Woke Up | Morning Light Exposure (Time & Duration) | Intensity (Outdoor/Indoor/Cloudy) | Evening Blue Light Exposure (Time & Duration) | Sleep Quality (1-5, 5=Best) | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Day 1** | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Day 2** | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Day 3** | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Day 4** | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Day 5** | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Day 6** | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Day 7** | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

**Interactive Elements:**
*   Use the `[ ]` fields for filling in times and durations.
*   Use the `[ ]` fields in the "Sleep Quality" column to circle or fill in a number from 1 to 5.

## 4. Reflection and Analysis

Review your completed tracker and answer the following questions to gain insight into your light habits.

1.  **Morning Consistency:** On average, how long after waking did I get my first dose of bright light?
    *   *Answer:* [ ]
2.  **Evening Habit:** On the nights I rated my sleep quality as 3 or lower, how much blue light exposure did I have in the 2 hours before bed?
    *   *Answer:* [ ]
3.  **Key Pattern:** What is the most significant correlation I see between my light exposure habits and my sleep quality or energy levels?
    *   *Answer:* [ ]

## 5. Action Steps for Optimization

Based on your analysis, commit to one or two specific, measurable actions this week.

| Action Area | Goal (Check when complete) | Specific Action Step |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morning Light** | [ ] Achieve 15 minutes of outdoor light within 45 minutes of waking on 5/7 days. | [ ] Walk to the mailbox or drink my coffee on the patio immediately after waking. |
| **Evening Light** | [ ] Eliminate screen time in the bedroom 6/7 nights. | [ ] Activate "Night Shift" or "Blue Light Filter" on all devices starting at 7:00 PM. |
| **Mid-Day Light** | [ ] Take a 10-minute walk during lunch break 3/5 workdays. | [ ] Schedule a recurring calendar reminder for 12:30 PM to take a light break. |
