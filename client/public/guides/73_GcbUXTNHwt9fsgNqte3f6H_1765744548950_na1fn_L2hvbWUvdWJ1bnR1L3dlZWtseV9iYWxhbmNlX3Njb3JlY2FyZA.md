## 1. Purpose and Instructions

The **Weekly Balance Scorecard (WBS)** is an evidence-based tool designed to help you, the client, gain a clear, objective view of your life balance across key domains. Consistent weekly assessment allows for the identification of trends, celebration of successes, and proactive adjustment of focus areas. This tool is designed for immediate use and should be completed at the end of each week (e.g., Sunday evening).

### How to Use This Scorecard:

1.  **Date:** Fill in the date range for the week you are reviewing.
2.  **Domain Scoring:** For each of the eight core life domains, assign a score from **1 (Extremely Dissatisfied/Neglected)** to **10 (Extremely Satisfied/Thriving)**. Be honest and base your score on your actual effort and results over the past seven days.
3.  **Reflection:** Answer the reflection questions to uncover the "why" behind your scores.
4.  **Action Planning:** Define 1-3 specific, measurable actions for the upcoming week to address areas of low score or maintain high-scoring domains.
