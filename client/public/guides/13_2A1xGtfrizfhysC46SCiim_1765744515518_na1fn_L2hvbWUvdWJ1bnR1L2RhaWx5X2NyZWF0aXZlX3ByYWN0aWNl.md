# Daily Creative Practice: The Momentum Builder

**Category:** Worksheet
**Purpose:** To establish a consistent, low-friction daily routine that cultivates creative flow, reduces performance anxiety, and builds a sustainable body of work. This practice is grounded in the principle of **deliberate practice** and the power of small, consistent efforts [1].

## Section 1: The Power of Consistency

The most significant barrier to creative success is not a lack of talent, but a lack of consistency. Research shows that daily, focused effort, even in small increments, leads to superior skill acquisition and neurological changes that support creative problem-solving [1]. This worksheet is designed to help you harness that power by making your creative work a non-negotiable daily habit.

**Key Principle: Lower the Bar.** Your daily practice should be so small and easy that you cannot say no to it. It is about showing up, not about producing a masterpiece.

## Section 2: The 5-Step Daily Creative Practice

Follow these steps each day to ensure a focused and productive creative session.

| Step | Instruction | Time Estimate | Check (x) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Define the Focus** | Before starting, clearly state the single, small creative task for the day. (e.g., "Write 200 words," "Sketch one object," "Mix two colors"). | 1 minute | [ ] |
| **2. Eliminate Distractions** | Put your phone on silent, close unnecessary tabs, and set a timer for your chosen duration. | 1 minute | [ ] |
| **3. Execute the Practice** | Work on your defined task with full, undivided attention. Do not edit, judge, or stop until the timer goes off or the task is complete. | 15-30 minutes | [ ] |
| **4. Capture Insights** | Immediately after, spend one minute writing down any insights, challenges, or ideas that emerged during the session. | 1 minute | [ ] |
| **5. Plan Tomorrow's Start** | Before closing your tools, define the very first step for your next session. This reduces friction for the next day. | 1 minute | [ ] |
