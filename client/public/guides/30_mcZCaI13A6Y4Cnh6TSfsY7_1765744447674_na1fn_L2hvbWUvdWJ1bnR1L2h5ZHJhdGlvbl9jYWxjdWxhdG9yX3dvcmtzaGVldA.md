**Material Name:** Hydration Calculator
**Category:** Worksheet
**Author:** Manus AI

## Purpose and Benefits

Proper hydration is **fundamental** to optimal health, impacting everything from cognitive function and energy levels to physical performance and digestion [1]. This worksheet provides a simple, evidence-based method to calculate your personalized daily fluid needs and a structured system to track your intake.

By using this calculator and tracker, you will:
*   Determine your baseline daily water requirement.
*   Adjust your intake based on your activity level.
*   Develop a consistent habit of monitoring your fluid consumption.
*   Improve overall well-being and energy.

## Section 1: Your Personalized Hydration Calculation

Your daily fluid requirement is primarily based on your body weight and activity level. Use the table below to calculate your target intake.

| Step | Description | Your Input | Calculation | Target Intake (oz) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Baseline Water** | Enter your current body weight in pounds (lbs). | [ ] lbs | (Input / 2) | [ ] oz |
| **2. Activity Adjustment** | Enter total minutes of intense exercise today. | [ ] mins | (Input / 30) * 12 | [ ] oz |
| **3. Total Daily Target** | Sum of Baseline Water (Step 1) and Activity Adjustment (Step 2). | | (Step 1 + Step 2) | **[ ] oz** |

***
**Calculation Notes:**
*   The baseline calculation (Body Weight / 2) provides a general guideline in ounces (oz) [2].
*   For every 30 minutes of intense exercise, an additional 12 ounces of fluid is recommended to replace sweat loss [3].
*   **1 US Fluid Ounce ≈ 29.57 mL**
