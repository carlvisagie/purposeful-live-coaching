# Environment Audit Checklist

**Material Name:** Environment Audit Checklist
**Category:** Checklist
**Author:** Manus AI

## Purpose and Instructions

The **Environment Audit Checklist** is a powerful tool designed to help you systematically evaluate and optimize the three primary environments that influence your performance, well-being, and goal attainment: your **Physical**, **Digital**, and **Social** spaces.

Research in environmental psychology and behavioral science consistently shows that our surroundings are not neutral; they either support or sabotage our intentions [1] [2]. This audit will help you identify environmental friction points and create a supportive ecosystem for success.

### How to Use This Checklist:

1.  **Audit:** Go through each section and honestly assess your current state.
2.  **Score:** Assign an **Impact Score** from 1 (Low Impact/Supportive) to 5 (High Impact/Sabotaging) to quantify how much this item is affecting your goals.
3.  **Reflect:** Answer the reflection questions to synthesize your findings.
4.  **Act:** Transfer your highest-priority friction points into the **Action Plan** table and commit to specific changes.

## Section 1: Physical Environment Audit

This section focuses on your immediate physical surroundings, including your workspace, home, and common areas.

| Audit Item | Current State (Fill-in) | Impact Score (1-5) | Friction Point? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Workspace Clutter Level** (0=Minimal, 10=Overwhelming) | | | [ ] |
| **Ergonomics** (Chair, desk, screen height support focus) | | | [ ] |
| **Lighting Quality** (Natural light access, appropriate task lighting) | | | [ ] |
| **Noise Level** (Distractions, interruptions, or excessive silence) | | | [ ] |
| **Aesthetics/Inspiration** (Does the space feel motivating and aligned with your values?) | | | [ ] |
| **Accessibility of Health Items** (Water, healthy snacks, exercise tools) | | | [ ] |
| **Visual Cues for Goals** (Reminders, vision board, or goal tracking visible) | | | [ ] |
| **Boundary Clarity** (Is your work area distinct from your rest area?) | | | [ ] |

## Section 2: Digital Environment Audit

This section assesses the structure and habits surrounding your digital tools, which are often the largest source of modern distraction and cognitive load.

| Audit Item | Current State (Fill-in) | Impact Score (1-5) | Friction Point? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Notification Management** (Are non-essential notifications disabled?) | | | [ ] |
| **Email Inbox System** (Is it organized, or does it serve as a to-do list?) | | | [ ] |
| **Desktop/File Organization** (Can you find files in under 30 seconds?) | | | [ ] |
| **Social Media Consumption** (Time spent vs. value gained) | | | [ ] |
| **App/Software Clutter** (Are unused apps deleted or hidden?) | | | [ ] |
| **Digital Security** (Password management, regular backups) | | | [ ] |
| **Information Overload** (Do you subscribe to too many newsletters/feeds?) | | | [ ] |
| **End-of-Day Digital Ritual** (Do you intentionally log off and disconnect?) | | | [ ] |

## Section 3: Social/Relational Environment Audit

Your social environment—the people you spend time with—profoundly affects your energy, mindset, and opportunities.

| Audit Item | Current State (Fill-in) | Impact Score (1-5) | Friction Point? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Support System Quality** (Do you have 3+ people who genuinely support your goals?) | | | [ ] |
| **Energy Vampires** (Time spent with people who drain your energy) | | | [ ] |
| **Accountability Partners** (Do you have someone to hold you accountable?) | | | [ ] |
| **Professional Network** (Is your network aligned with your career trajectory?) | | | [ ] |
| **Boundary Setting** (Are you able to say "no" to non-essential commitments?) | | | [ ] |
| **Conflict Resolution** (Are key relational conflicts unresolved?) | | | [ ] |
| **Inspirational Input** (Are you regularly exposed to people who inspire you?) | | | [ ] |
| **Relational Clarity** (Are your expectations clear in key relationships?) | | | [ ] |

## Reflection Questions

Use these questions to synthesize your audit findings and identify the most critical areas for change.

1.  **The Single Biggest Drain:** Based on your Impact Scores, which single item across all three environments is the most significant drain on your energy or focus?
    *   *Answer:* [ ]
2.  **The Quickest Win:** What is one change you could make in the next 24 hours that would immediately improve one of your environments?
    *   *Answer:* [ ]
3.  **The Environmental Gap:** Describe the difference between your current environment and the ideal environment that would make achieving your primary goal inevitable.
    *   *Answer:* [ ]

## Action Steps: Environmental Optimization Plan

Transfer the top 3-5 friction points (those with the highest Impact Scores) into this plan. Focus on specific, measurable actions.

| Priority Area (e.g., Workspace Clutter) | Specific Action (What, When, How) | Deadline | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
