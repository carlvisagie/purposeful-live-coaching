# Daily Energy Tracker: Optimizing Performance and Focus

## Purpose and Rationale

The **Daily Energy Tracker** is a foundational tool for high-performance coaching clients. It moves beyond simple time management to focus on **energy management**, which is the true driver of sustained productivity and well-being [1]. By systematically tracking where your energy is gained and lost, you can identify patterns, eliminate drains, and strategically schedule your most demanding tasks during your peak energy windows. This evidence-based approach ensures you are not just busy, but **effective**.

## Instructions for Use

1.  **Baseline Rating:** At the start of the day, briefly rate your initial energy level (1-10).
2.  **Hourly Check-in:** At three key points—Morning (e.g., 10 AM), Midday (e.g., 2 PM), and Evening (e.g., 6 PM)—rate your current energy level.
3.  **Identify Sources and Drains:** For each check-in, identify the primary activity, thought, or interaction that either **fueled** your energy (Source) or **depleted** it (Drain). Be specific (e.g., "Source: 15-minute walk outside," "Drain: Unscheduled meeting with Client X").
4.  **Review and Reflect:** Use the "Daily Reflection" section to synthesize your findings and plan for the next day.

## Energy Tracking Log

**Date:** [ ]

| Time Block | Energy Level (1-10) | Primary Energy Source (What fueled me?) | Primary Energy Drain (What depleted me?) | Notes/Observations |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morning** (Start - 12:00 PM) | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Midday** (12:00 PM - 4:00 PM) | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Evening** (4:00 PM - End) | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

### Key Energy Metrics

| Metric | Rating/Check |
| :--- | :--- |
| Initial Energy Level (Start of Day) | [ ] / 10 |
| Quality of Sleep (Last Night) | [ ] / 10 |
| Did I take a dedicated break today? | [ ] (Check one: Yes / No) |
| Did I complete my single most important task (MIT)? | [ ] (Check one: Yes / No) |

## Daily Reflection and Insight

Use these questions to transform your data into actionable insights.

1.  **Peak Performance Window:** Based on today's data, when was my energy highest? What was I doing during that time?
    *   *Reflection:* [ ]
2.  **The Energy Leak:** What was the single biggest energy drain today? Was it a person, a task, or a habit?
    *   *Reflection:* [ ]
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** What is one thing I did today that I can consistently repeat to boost my energy?
    *   *Reflection:* [ ]

## Action Steps for Tomorrow

Based on your reflection, commit to one or two high-leverage actions for the next 24 hours.

-   **Protect My Peak:** I will schedule my most cognitively demanding task (e.g., [ ]) during my peak energy window (e.g., [ ]).
    *   [ ] (Check when scheduled)
-   **Plug the Leak:** I will mitigate or eliminate today's biggest energy drain by (e.g., setting a boundary, delegating, or blocking time): [ ]
    *   [ ] (Check when completed)
-   **Recharge Protocol:** I will ensure I take a minimum of two 10-minute breaks today.
    *   [ ] (Check when completed)

## Evidence-Based Foundation

This tracker is based on the principles of **Ultradian Rhythms** and **Restorative Naps** [2], which suggest that the human body naturally cycles between high-frequency (90-120 minute) activity and rest periods. Ignoring these cycles leads to burnout and diminished returns. Effective energy management is a core component of sustainable high-performance [3].
