### What is a Growth Mindset?

A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. It is the opposite of a fixed mindset, which is the belief that your abilities are fixed and cannot be changed.

People with a growth mindset are more likely to:

*   Embrace challenges
*   Persist in the face of setbacks
*   See effort as a path to mastery
*   Learn from criticism
*   Find lessons and inspiration in the success of others
