# Meal Timing Planner: Optimizing Performance and Energy

## Purpose

This **Meal Timing Planner** is a structured worksheet designed to help you, the client, strategically plan your food intake around your daily schedule, particularly focusing on optimizing energy levels, cognitive function, and physical performance. Research indicates that *when* you eat can be as crucial as *what* you eat for metabolic health and sustained energy throughout the day [1]. By using this planner, you will identify your personal energy peaks and troughs and align your meals and snacks to support peak performance.

## Instructions

1.  **Complete the Daily Schedule:** In the table below, fill in your typical daily schedule, noting key activities (e.g., meetings, workouts, deep work sessions).
2.  **Log Current Meal Times:** Record the times you currently eat your main meals and snacks.
3.  **Assess Energy Levels:** Rate your energy and focus levels *before* and *after* each meal/snack on a scale of 1 (Low) to 5 (High).
4.  **Plan Optimized Timing:** Based on your energy assessment, adjust your meal times in the "Optimized Meal Time" column to better support your high-priority activities.
5.  **Implement and Review:** Use the "Tracking Table" for one week and then complete the "Reflection Questions" and "Action Steps."
