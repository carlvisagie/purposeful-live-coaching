# Intentional Living Planner

**Material Name:** Intentional Living Planner
**Category:** Template
**Author:** Manus AI

## Purpose and Instructions

The **Intentional Living Planner** is a powerful tool designed to help you bridge the gap between your deepest values and your daily actions. Intentional living, rooted in psychological principles of **self-concordance** and **mindfulness** [1], involves consciously choosing how to spend your time and energy, rather than reacting to external demands. This planner provides a structured framework to clarify your core purpose, set meaningful goals, and ensure your daily habits align with the life you truly want to build.

**Instructions for Use:**

1.  **Complete the Core Values Clarification** first to establish your foundation.
2.  **Define your Vision and Goals** based on your clarified values.
3.  **Use the Weekly Action Plan** to translate your goals into concrete, daily steps.
4.  **Review and Reflect** at the end of the week to maintain momentum and make necessary adjustments.
