## 1. Purpose and Evidence-Base

The **Morning Pages** practice is a foundational tool for creative recovery and personal clarity, popularized by author Julia Cameron in her seminal work, *The Artist's Way* [1]. It involves writing three pages of longhand, stream-of-consciousness text first thing in the morning.

The core purpose of Morning Pages is to perform a "brain dump"—to clear the mind of all the thoughts, worries, and anxieties that clutter the subconscious. This process is not about producing good writing; it is about getting past the internal censor and accessing deeper, more authentic thoughts. Evidence suggests that expressive writing can lead to improved working memory, reduced intrusive thoughts, and enhanced emotional regulation, making this a powerful tool for coaching clients seeking mental clarity and reduced creative block [2].

> "Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream-of-consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning. There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages—they are not supposed to sound smart or profound. They are simply about getting it all out." — Julia Cameron [1]

## 2. How to Use This Template: The Morning Pages Practice

Follow these simple, non-negotiable rules to maximize the benefit of your Morning Pages session:

1.  **Three Pages, No More, No Less:** Write exactly three full pages of standard notebook paper. If using a digital format, aim for a minimum of 750 words, which is the approximate equivalent.
2.  **Longhand Only:** The physical act of writing by hand engages the brain differently than typing, slowing down the internal critic.
3.  **Stream-of-Consciousness:** Write whatever comes to mind. It can be a complaint, a worry, a grocery list, or a profound insight. Do not stop, do not edit, and do not worry about grammar or sense.
4.  **No Re-Reading:** Do not read your Morning Pages immediately after writing. The pages are for purging, not for analysis. Wait at least a week before reviewing them, if at all.
5.  **First Thing in the Morning:** Complete the pages before engaging with email, news, or social media to capture the raw, unfiltered state of your mind.

## 5. Post-Writing Reflection and Action

After you have completed your three pages, take a moment to briefly review the experience (but not the content of the pages themselves).

### Reflection Questions (To be answered *after* the session)

1.  **What is the dominant emotion or theme that emerged today?**
    [**Fill-in Answer**]

2.  **What is one small, immediate insight or realization I had during the process?**
    [**Fill-in Answer**]

3.  **What is one thing I need to let go of today (a worry, a task, a judgment)?**
    [**Fill-in Answer**]

### Action Steps (Translating Clarity into Movement)

Based on your reflection, identify one small, concrete action you can take today to honor the clarity you gained.

| Action Step | Priority (High/Med/Low) | Due Date | Completed |

| **[Fill-in]** | **[Fill-in]** | **[Fill-in]** | [ ] |
