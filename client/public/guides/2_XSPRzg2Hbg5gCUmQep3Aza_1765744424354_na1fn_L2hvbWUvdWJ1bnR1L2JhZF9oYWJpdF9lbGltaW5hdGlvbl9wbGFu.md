# Bad Habit Elimination Plan: The 4-Step Friction Method

**Category:** Worksheet
**Purpose:** This plan is designed to help you systematically identify, analyze, and eliminate unwanted habits by increasing the friction required to perform them. It is based on the evidence-based principle that making a behavior **difficult** and **unsatisfying** is the most effective path to elimination [1].

## Phase 1: Identify and Analyze the Habit Loop

Every habit, good or bad, follows a four-step pattern: **Cue** (trigger), **Craving** (motivation), **Response** (the habit itself), and **Reward** (the benefit). To eliminate a bad habit, we must disrupt this loop.

### Reflection Questions (Cue & Craving)

Use the space below to analyze the habit you wish to eliminate.

1.  **The Habit to Eliminate:** [Fill-in: e.g., Scrolling social media after 9 PM]
2.  **The Primary Cue (Trigger):** What immediately precedes the habit? (Time, location, emotion, person, or preceding action)
    [Fill-in: ]
3.  **The Craving:** What is the underlying feeling or state you are trying to achieve or escape? (e.g., relief, stimulation, comfort, distraction)
    [Fill-in: ]

## Phase 2: The 4-Step Friction Method

This method reverses the laws of behavior change to make the bad habit **Invisible, Unattractive, Difficult, and Unsatisfying**.

### Step 1: Make it Invisible (Disrupt the Cue)

The goal is to eliminate the trigger from your environment.

| Strategy | Action Step (What will you do?) | Status (☐ Done) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Remove the Cue:** Hide or remove the objects associated with the habit. | [Fill-in: e.g., Move the TV remote out of the living room.] | ☐ |
| **Avoid the Environment:** Stay away from places or people that trigger the habit. | [Fill-in: e.g., Do not enter the kitchen after dinner.] | ☐ |
| **Change Digital Triggers:** Use app blockers or screen time limits. | [Fill-in: e.g., Install a website blocker on my laptop for the social media site.] | ☐ |

### Step 2: Make it Unattractive (Reduce the Craving)

The goal is to reframe the habit to highlight its long-term negative consequences.

| Strategy | Action Step (What will you do?) | Status (☐ Done) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Highlight the Cost:** Write down the true cost (time, money, health) of the habit. | [Fill-in: e.g., I will lose 7 hours of productive time this week if I continue.] | ☐ |
| **"Habit Contract":** Publicly state your intention to quit to an accountability partner. | [Fill-in: e.g., I will tell my partner about my plan and ask them to check in daily.] | ☐ |
| **Use "Temptation Bundling" in Reverse:** Pair the bad habit with something you *dislike*. | [Fill-in: e.g., If I smoke, I must immediately do 10 push-ups.] | ☐ |

### Step 3: Make it Difficult (Increase the Response Friction)

The goal is to increase the number of steps required to perform the bad habit.

| Strategy | Action Step (What will you do?) | Status (☐ Done) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Increase Friction:** Add a physical barrier or step. | [Fill-in: e.g., Unplug the gaming console and put the power cord in a locked drawer.] | ☐ |
| **"Two-Minute Rule" in Reverse:** Make the bad habit take *more* than two minutes to start. | [Fill-in: e.g., Log out of all streaming services so I have to re-enter my password every time.] | ☐ |
| **Use a Commitment Device:** Make a future action difficult to reverse. | [Fill-in: e.g., Freeze my credit card in a block of ice to prevent impulse purchases.] | ☐ |

### Step 4: Make it Unsatisfying (Change the Reward)

The goal is to introduce immediate negative consequences or find a positive replacement reward.

| Strategy | Action Step (What will you do?) | Status (☐ Done) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate Punishment:** Introduce a small, immediate penalty for failure. | [Fill-in: e.g., Every time I check my phone unnecessarily, I must donate $5 to a charity I dislike.] | ☐ |
| **Positive Replacement:** Identify a healthy habit that delivers a similar reward. | [Fill-in: e.g., When I crave a sugary snack (Craving: Comfort), I will drink a cup of herbal tea (Reward: Comfort).] | ☐ |
| **Track Failure:** Use a tracking system to visually record every time you perform the bad habit. | [Fill-in: e.g., I will put a red 'X' on a calendar for every lapse.] | ☐ |

## Phase 3: Weekly Tracking and Reflection

Use this table to track your progress and identify patterns.

| Date | Did I perform the habit? (Y/N) | What was the Cue? | What was the Replacement Action? | Reflection/Learning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Date] | [Y/N] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] |
| [Date] | [Y/N] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] |
| [Date] | [Y/N] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] |
| [Date] | [Y/N] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] |
| [Date] | [Y/N] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] |
| [Date] | [Y/N] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] |
| [Date] | [Y/N] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] | [Fill-in] |
