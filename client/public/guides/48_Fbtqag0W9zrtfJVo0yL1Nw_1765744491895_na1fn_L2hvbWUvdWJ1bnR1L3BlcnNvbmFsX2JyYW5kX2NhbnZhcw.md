# Personal Brand Canvas: Define Your Unique Value

**Category:** Worksheet

## Purpose and Instructions

The **Personal Brand Canvas** is a strategic framework designed to help you define, articulate, and manage your professional identity. It is a single-page tool, inspired by the Business Model Canvas, that breaks down your brand into nine essential building blocks. By completing this canvas, you will gain clarity on your unique value proposition, target audience, and communication strategy, making your brand development intentional and actionable.

This material is a **worksheet** intended for coaching clients to be completed in a structured session or as a guided self-study exercise.

### How to Use This Canvas

1.  **Allocate Time:** Dedicate at least 60-90 minutes of focused, uninterrupted time.
2.  **Be Honest:** Your brand must be authentic. Answer the questions truthfully, not how you think you *should* answer.
3.  **Be Concise:** Use keywords, short phrases, and clear statements. The goal is clarity, not prose.
4.  **Iterate:** This is a living document. Review and update your canvas every 6-12 months.

## Evidence-Based Rationale

The Personal Brand Canvas is a derivative of the widely-used Business Model Canvas (BMC), a strategic management template for developing new or documenting existing business models [1]. The BMC's success lies in its visual, structured approach to complex concepts. Applying this methodology to personal branding provides a robust, evidence-based framework that moves beyond abstract concepts to concrete, actionable components [2]. The nine sections are adapted to cover the essential elements of a personal brand, including internal drivers (Values, Strengths, Purpose) and external execution (Audience, Channels, Metrics).
