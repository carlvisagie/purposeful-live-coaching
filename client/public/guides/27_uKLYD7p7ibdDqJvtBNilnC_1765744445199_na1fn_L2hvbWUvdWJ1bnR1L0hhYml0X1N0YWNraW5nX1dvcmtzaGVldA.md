# Habit Stacking Worksheet: Building New Routines with Ease

**Author:** Manus AI

## Purpose and Overview

The **Habit Stacking Worksheet** is a powerful tool designed to help you integrate new, desired behaviors into your daily life by linking them to existing, established habits. This technique, rooted in behavioral science, leverages the principle that a reliable cue (your current habit) can trigger a new action (your desired habit), making the new behavior automatic and effortless [1].

**Goal:** To create a clear, actionable plan for seamlessly integrating a new habit into your existing daily routine using the "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]" formula.

## Instructions for Use

1.  **Identify:** Complete the Habit Audit to list your current, stable daily routines.
2.  **Define:** Clearly state the new habit you wish to build. Keep it small and specific.
3.  **Stack:** Use the Habit Stacking Formula to pair your new habit with a suitable existing habit.
4.  **Commit & Track:** Implement your plan and use the tracking table to monitor your progress for the first week.

## Section 1: The Habit Audit - Identifying Your Current Habits

Before you can stack a new habit, you must identify a stable, existing habit to serve as the trigger. List 5-7 routines you perform reliably every day.

| Time of Day | Current Habit (The Cue) | Reliability (Check if performed 90%+ of the time) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Morning | [ ] | [ ] |
| Morning | [ ] | [ ] |
| Mid-day | [ ] | [ ] |
| Mid-day | [ ] | [ ] |
| Evening | [ ] | [ ] |
| Evening | [ ] | [ ] |
| Before Bed | [ ] | [ ] |

## Section 2: Defining Your New Habit and The Stacking Formula

Choose **one** new habit you want to implement and pair it with a strong cue from your audit. Remember to keep the new habit small (e.g., "do one push-up" instead of "exercise for 30 minutes").

**1. My New Desired Habit (Must be small and specific):**
________________________________________________________________________________

**2. My Chosen Current Habit (The Cue):**
________________________________________________________________________________

**3. The Habit Stacking Formula:**
Complete the sentence below to formalize your plan.

> **After** I ____________________________________________________ (Current Habit/Cue),
> **I will** ____________________________________________________ (New Habit).

**Example:** *After I pour my first cup of coffee, I will read one page of a non-fiction book.*

## Section 3: The Habit Stacking Implementation Plan

Detail your final stacking plan and use the tracking table to monitor your consistency.

| Habit Stack | Location/Context | Why this pairing works for me |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit]. | [Where will this happen?] | [What is the immediate benefit or feeling?] |
| | | |

### Weekly Tracking Log

Use this log to track your consistency for the first 7 days. Mark 'X' for successful completion.

| Day | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | Notes/Obstacles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Success? | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | |

## Reflection and Adjustment Questions

Use these questions to reflect on your progress and make necessary adjustments to your stack.

1.  **Friction Check:** Was the new habit too large or complex? If so, how can I simplify it to take less than two minutes?
    ________________________________________________________________________________
2.  **Cue Reliability:** Did I miss the current habit (the cue)? If so, what is a more reliable cue I can use?
    ________________________________________________________________________________
3.  **Environment:** What changes can I make to my environment to make the new habit easier to perform (e.g., putting the book next to the coffee maker)?
    ________________________________________________________________________________
