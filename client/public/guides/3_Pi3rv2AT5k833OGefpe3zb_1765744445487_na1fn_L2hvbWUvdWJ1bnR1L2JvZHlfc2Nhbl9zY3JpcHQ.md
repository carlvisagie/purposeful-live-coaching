# Body Scan Script: Anchoring Presence and Awareness

**Material Name:** Body Scan Script
**Category:** Guide
**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Purpose and Clear Instructions

The **Body Scan** is a core mindfulness practice for cultivating present-moment awareness by systematically directing attention to the body. It is a powerful tool for stress reduction, emotional regulation, and deepening the mind-body connection [1].

**Your Goal:** Practice non-judgmental awareness of physical sensations, recognizing that thoughts and feelings are temporary events.

### Instructions for Use

1.  **Set Aside Time:** Dedicate 15-30 minutes without interruption.
2.  **Find a Position:** Lie down on your back (or sit comfortably). Arms at your sides, palms up or down, legs extended naturally.
3.  **Use the Script:** Read slowly or record for playback. Move deliberately.
4.  **Non-Judgmental Observation:** Notice sensations (warmth, pressure, etc.). If your mind wanders, gently redirect attention back to the body part.

## 2. The Body Scan Script

> **Note:** Read the script slowly, pausing 30-60 seconds between sections for full attention.

### Beginning the Practice

"Gently close your eyes. Take three deep, slow breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling fully. Allow your body to settle, releasing tension in your shoulders or jaw. Feel the support beneath you."

### Lower Body: Feet and Legs

"Bring your attention to your **left foot**: toes, sole, and heel. Simply observe. Move awareness up to your **left ankle** and **lower leg**. Notice contact points. Continue to your **left knee** and **left thigh**. Notice the weight of your leg."

"Shift attention to your **right foot**: toes, arch, and heel. Move awareness up to your **right ankle** and **lower leg**. Notice the feeling of your skin. Continue to your **right knee** and **right thigh**. Feel both legs resting, heavy and supported."

### Torso and Core

"Bring awareness to your **pelvic area and hips**. Notice tension or relaxation. Spread attention across your **lower back** and **abdomen**. Notice the gentle movement of your breath. Move awareness up into your **chest and upper back**. Notice the expansion and contraction with each breath. Feel your heart beating gently."

### Upper Body: Hands and Arms

"Shift attention to your **right hand**: palm, back, and fingers. Feel the temperature and texture. Move awareness up your **right wrist**, **forearm**, **elbow**, **upper arm**, and **shoulder**. Allow the right arm to be heavy."

"Shift attention to your **left hand**: fingers and palm. Move awareness up your **left wrist**, **forearm**, **elbow**, **upper arm**, and **shoulder**. Allow the left arm to be heavy."

### Neck and Head

"Bring attention to your **neck and throat**. Notice tightness and allow it to soften. Move awareness to your **jaw, mouth, and tongue**. Let your jaw hang loose. Notice your **cheeks, nose, and eyes**. Let your eyes rest deeply. Finally, bring attention to your **forehead and the top of your head**. Notice the entire head resting."

### Whole Body Awareness

"Expand your awareness to include your **entire body**. Feel the simultaneous sensations from toes to crown. Rest in this whole-body awareness. When ready, gently wiggle fingers and toes, and slowly open your eyes, bringing this sense of presence with you."
