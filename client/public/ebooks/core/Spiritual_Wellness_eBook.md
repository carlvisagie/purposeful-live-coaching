## Chapter 1: Exploring Your Values

They are the compass that helps you to navigate the complexities of the world and make choices that are in alignment with your authentic self. This chapter will help you to identify your core values and use them to create a more meaningful and fulfilling life.

### Values vs. Goals

It is important to understand the difference between values and goals. Goals are specific achievements that you can cross off a list. Values, on the other hand, are ongoing principles that guide your behavior. For example, a goal might be to run a marathon, while a value might be to live a healthy and active life.

When your actions are in alignment with your values, you experience a sense of authenticity and fulfillment. When your actions are in conflict with your values, you may feel a sense of unease or dissatisfaction. This chapter will help you to identify areas of your life where you may be out of alignment with your values and make changes to live a more value-driven life.

### Using Values as a Decision-Making Compass

Your values can be a powerful tool for making decisions. When faced with a choice, you can ask yourself which option is most in alignment with your core values. This can help you to make choices that are right for you, even when they are difficult.
