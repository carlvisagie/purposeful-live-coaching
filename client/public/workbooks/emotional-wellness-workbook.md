## Lesson 1: Understanding Your Emotions

### Key Concepts

**What are emotions?**
Emotions are complex psychological states involving three components:
- **Subjective experience** - How you personally feel
- **Physiological response** - Body sensations and reactions
- **Behavioral response** - How you express or act on the emotion

**Why emotions matter:**
- Emotions provide rapid information about our environment
- They motivate us to take action
- They help us communicate our needs
- They guide decision-making

### The Emotion Wheel

Primary emotions branch into more nuanced secondary and tertiary emotions:

**Happy** → Joyful, Grateful, Peaceful, Powerful, Accepted, Proud
**Sad** → Lonely, Vulnerable, Despair, Guilty, Depressed, Hurt
**Angry** → Let down, Humiliated, Bitter, Mad, Frustrated, Critical
**Fearful** → Scared, Anxious, Insecure, Weak, Rejected, Threatened
**Surprised** → Startled, Confused, Amazed, Excited
**Disgusted** → Disapproving, Disappointed, Awful, Repelled

### Reflection Exercise

**Think of a recent emotional experience:**

What happened?


What emotion(s) did you feel?


How intense was it (1-10)?


What physical sensations did you notice?


What thoughts went through your mind?


How did you respond?


Looking back, what was the emotion trying to tell you?
