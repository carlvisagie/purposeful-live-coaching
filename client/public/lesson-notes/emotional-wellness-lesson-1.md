## Key Concepts

### What Are Emotions?

Emotions are complex psychological states that involve three distinct components:

1. **Subjective Experience** - How you personally feel the emotion
2. **Physiological Response** - Body sensations and physical reactions
3. **Behavioral/Expressive Response** - How you show or act on the emotion

### The Purpose of Emotions

Emotions serve important evolutionary functions:
- **Provide rapid information** about our environment
- **Motivate action** to meet our needs
- **Communicate** our internal state to others
- **Guide decision-making** based on past experiences

### Primary vs. Secondary Emotions

**Primary Emotions** (universal, innate):
- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Fearful
- Surprised
- Disgusted

**Secondary Emotions** (combinations and variations):
- Anxious (fear + anticipation)
- Frustrated (anger + disappointment)
- Guilty (sad + self-blame)
- Proud (happy + accomplishment)

### Angry Family
- Let down, Humiliated, Bitter, Mad, Aggressive, Frustrated, Distant, Critical

### Surprised Family
- Startled, Confused, Amazed, Excited

### Disgusted Family

## Key Takeaways

1. **Emotions are information** - They tell us what matters to us
2. **All emotions are valid** - Even uncomfortable ones serve a purpose
3. **The emotion wheel helps** - Identify nuanced feelings beyond basic categories
4. **Emotional awareness is foundational** - First step to emotional intelligence

## Emotional Granularity

**Definition:** The ability to make fine-grained distinctions among emotions

**Why it matters:**
- People with higher emotional granularity experience better mental health
- More specific emotion labels lead to more effective emotion regulation
- Helps communicate needs more clearly to others
- Enables more targeted coping strategies

**Example:**
- Low granularity: "I feel bad"
- High granularity: "I feel disappointed that my effort wasn't recognized, and a bit embarrassed that I expected it would be"
