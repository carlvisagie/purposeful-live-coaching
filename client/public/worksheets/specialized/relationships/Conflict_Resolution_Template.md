### Step 1: Cool Down

*If you are feeling angry or upset, take some time to cool down before you try to resolve the conflict. This may mean taking a walk, listening to music, or practicing a relaxation technique.*

### Step 2: Express Your Feelings Using "I" Statements

*Use "I" statements to express your feelings without blaming or accusing the other person.*

**"I feel** [emotion] **when** [situation]**.**"

**Example:** "I feel hurt when you make jokes about my cooking."

### Step 3: Listen Actively to the Other Person's Perspective

*Give the other person a chance to express their feelings and perspective without interruption. Try to understand their point of view, even if you don't agree with it.*

### Step 4: Brainstorm Solutions

*Work together to brainstorm a list of possible solutions to the problem. Be creative and open to new ideas.*

### Step 5: Choose a Solution and Make a Plan

*Choose a solution that you can both agree on. Make a plan for how you will implement the solution and how you will check in with each other to make sure it is working.*
