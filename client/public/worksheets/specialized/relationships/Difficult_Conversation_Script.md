### Step 1: Prepare for the Conversation

*Before you have the conversation, take some time to prepare. Think about what you want to say and what you want to achieve.*

**1. What is the purpose of this conversation?**



**2. What are the key points I want to make?**



**3. What is my desired outcome for this conversation?**



**4. What are some potential obstacles or challenges that might arise?**



**5. How can I approach this conversation with curiosity and respect?**



### Step 2: The Conversation

*Use the following script to guide your conversation. Remember to be flexible and to adapt to the other person's responses.*

**1. State your intention:** "I want to talk to you about... I want to understand your perspective and to find a solution that works for both of us."

**2. Express your feelings using "I" statements:** "I feel... when... I need..."

**3. Listen actively to the other person's perspective:** Paraphrase what you hear to make sure you understand. "What I'm hearing you say is... Is that right?"

**4. Brainstorm solutions together:** "What are some possible solutions to this problem?"

**5. Choose a solution and make a plan:** "Let's agree to... How can we make sure we stick to this plan?"

### Step 3: Follow Up

*After the conversation, it can be helpful to follow up with the other person to make sure you are both on the same page and to see how the solution is working.*
