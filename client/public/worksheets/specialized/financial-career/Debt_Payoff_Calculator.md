### Debt Payoff Strategy

*There are two popular debt payoff strategies: the debt snowball and the debt avalanche.*

*   **Debt Snowball:** You pay off your debts in order from the smallest balance to the largest, regardless of the interest rate. This can help you to stay motivated by giving you quick wins.
*   **Debt Avalanche:** You pay off your debts in order from the highest interest rate to the lowest, regardless of the balance. This can save you money on interest in the long run.
