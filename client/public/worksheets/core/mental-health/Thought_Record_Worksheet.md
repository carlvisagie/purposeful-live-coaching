### Common Cognitive Distortions

*Use this list to help you identify any thinking errors in your automatic thoughts.*

*   **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Seeing things in black-and-white categories. If your performance falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.
*   **Overgeneralization:** Seeing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.
*   **Mental Filter:** Picking out a single negative detail and dwelling on it exclusively so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened.
*   **Disqualifying the Positive:** Rejecting positive experiences by insisting they "don't count" for some reason or other.
*   **Jumping to Conclusions:** Making a negative interpretation even though there are no definite facts that convincingly support your conclusion.
    *   **Mind Reading:** You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out.
    *   **The Fortune Teller Error:** You anticipate that things will turn out badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact.
*   **Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization:** You exaggerate the importance of things (such as your goof-up or someone else's achievement), or you inappropriately shrink things until they appear tiny (your own desirable qualities or the other fellow's imperfections).
*   **Emotional Reasoning:** You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: "I feel it, therefore it must be true."
*   **Should Statements:** You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts, as if you had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to do anything. "Musts" and "oughts" are also offenders. The emotional consequence is guilt.
*   **Labeling and Mislabeling:** This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing your error, you attach a negative label to yourself: "I'm a loser." When someone else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label to him: "He's a damn louse."
*   **Personalization:** You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which in fact you were not primarily responsible for.
