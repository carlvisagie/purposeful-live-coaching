### Understanding Self-Compassion

Self-compassion is not about self-pity or self-indulgence. It is about extending the same care and concern to yourself that you would to a good friend. The three core components of self-compassion are:

*   **Self-Kindness:** Being warm and understanding toward ourselves when we suffer, fail, or feel inadequate, rather than ignoring our pain or flagellating ourselves with self-criticism.
*   **Common Humanity:** Recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy are part of the shared human experience – something that we all go through rather than being something that happens to “me” alone.
*   **Mindfulness:** Taking a balanced approach to our negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated. We cannot ignore our pain and feel compassion for it at the same time.

### Self-Compassion Break

*This is a simple and powerful practice that you can use anytime you are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, or self-critical.*

1.  **Acknowledge the suffering:** "This is a moment of suffering."
2.  **Connect with common humanity:** "Suffering is a part of life."
3.  **Offer yourself kindness:** "May I be kind to myself."

### Self-Compassionate Letter

*Write a letter to yourself from the perspective of a compassionate friend. In the letter, acknowledge your struggles, validate your feelings, and offer words of encouragement and support.*

### Soothing Touch

*Physical touch can be a powerful way to activate the care system and release oxytocin, the “love hormone.” Try placing your hands over your heart, giving yourself a gentle hug, or cradling your face in your hands.*

### Guided Meditations

*There are many excellent guided meditations available online that can help you to cultivate self-compassion. Search for meditations by Kristin Neff, Tara Brach, or Jack Kornfield.*
