## Overview

At PurposefulLive, we strive to provide exceptional AI-powered coaching services. This Refund Policy explains our approach to refunds and cancellations for our subscription-based services.

---

## 7-Day Free Trial

All new subscribers receive a **7-day free trial** period. During this trial:

- You have **full access** to all features of your selected tier
- You will **not be charged** during the trial period
- You can **cancel anytime** during the trial with no charges
- If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription

**No refunds are necessary for free trial cancellations** since no payment has been processed.

### Cancellation Policy

Monthly subscriptions can be canceled at any time through your account dashboard. When you cancel:

- Your access **continues until the end of your current billing period**
- You will **not be charged** for subsequent months
- **No refunds** are provided for the current billing period
- You can **reactivate** your subscription at any time

### No Refunds for Partial Months

We do not provide refunds for partial months of service. If you cancel on day 15 of your billing cycle, you will retain access for the remaining 15 days, but no refund will be issued for unused time.
