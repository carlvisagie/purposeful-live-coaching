## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Launch with current features - You're ready
2. ✅ Get first 10-25 customers
3. ✅ Validate product-market fit

### Month 1-2 (After First Revenue)
4. Add **Weekly Insights** (biggest retention driver)
5. Add **Meditation Library** (standard feature, users expect it)
6. Add **Habit Tracking** (daily engagement)
7. Add **Journaling Prompts** (quick win)

### Month 3-4 (After $3,000-5,000 MRR)
8. Add **Sleep Support** (major pain point)

---

## Bottom Line

**You can launch NOW** with your current feature set. You have the core value proposition (AI coaching + crisis detection + human sessions).

**But to compete long-term** with Wysa, Headspace, and Ash, you need to add:
1. Weekly insights (retention)
2. Meditation library (table stakes)
3. Habit tracking (engagement)
4. Sleep support (pain point)

**Timeline:** Add these 4 features in Month 1-2 (after first revenue), and you'll be competitive with the top apps in the market.

**Your Advantage:** You have something they don't - **9.5/10 AI quality + human coaching integration**. That's your moat. The missing features are "nice to haves" that improve engagement, but your core value prop is already strong.

**Launch first. Add features second. Let revenue fund development.** 🚀
