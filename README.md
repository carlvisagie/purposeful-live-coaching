# 🛑 STOP. DO NOT WRITE CODE YET.

## This is a LIVE production platform generating revenue.

**Before you do ANYTHING, you must:**

1. **Read `MASTER_GUIDE.md`** - The entire thing. Not skimming. Reading.

2. **Answer these 3 questions** (paste your answers before proceeding):
   - What is **ProfileGuard** and why must every user-facing module use it?
   - Name 3 features that are ALREADY BUILT (so you don't rebuild them)
   - What is the #1 priority for all development work?

3. **State this confirmation:**
   > "I have read MASTER_GUIDE.md. I understand this is a live platform. I will not rebuild existing features. I will integrate ProfileGuard in any user-facing code."

## If you skip this and break something:

- Real users lose access to their coaching
- Real revenue is lost
- Real trust is destroyed

**There is no "undo" on a live platform.**
