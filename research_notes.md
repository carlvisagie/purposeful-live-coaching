## Chase Hughes F.A.T.E. Model (from LinkedIn article)

The FATE model is a framework for understanding psychological drivers in sales:

**F - Focus & Novelty**
- Capture attention with something novel and attention-grabbing
- In a world of distractions, capturing attention is the first challenge
- Open with surprising facts or pattern interrupts, not generic pitches

**A - Authority & Leadership**  
- Position yourself as a trusted expert
- Demonstrate expertise and leadership
- Example: "After analyzing X patterns, I've identified three critical factors..."

**T - Tribe & Belonging**
- Create tribal connection through social proof and belonging
- "You'd be joining a community of forward-thinking [people like you]..."
- Tap into the power of social connection

**E - Emotion & Experience**
- Address emotional drivers by understanding personal experiences
- Acknowledge their frustrations and pain points
- "That sounds incredibly frustrating. Many of our current clients came to us after similar experiences."

## Key Integration Principles:
1. Capture Focus with something novel
2. Establish Authority by demonstrating expertise
3. Create Tribal Connection through social proof
4. Address Emotional Drivers by understanding personal experiences

When these work together = "invisible influence" - persuasion that feels natural because it aligns with fundamental human psychology.

## The Ancestral Advantage
- These tap into hardwired ancestral programming
- Not manipulative - recognition of how brains naturally process information
